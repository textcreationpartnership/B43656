            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO THE READER.</head>
            <p>IT is not to multiply Books unseason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably, or encrease <hi>Controversie;</hi> no Ambitious Design for Applause, much less to abet any <hi>Faction</hi> or <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi> that occasioned the Publication of this <hi>Brief Treatise.</hi> I am not ignorant that many excellent Men have written <hi>Systems</hi> or Bodies of Divinity much more accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately; to whose Pains, as I pay a just Tribute of Praise and Reverend Esteem, acknowleding my self and others much indebted to them for the same, so I hope I may crave leave to say, That their Works being chiefly penn'd for the Use of the
<pb facs="tcp:208153:3"/>
               <hi>Learned,</hi> or Help at least of <hi>Young Students</hi> in Theology, seemed not so much adapted to the Understanding of Lay <hi>Æ²nlearned Christians,</hi> whose Benefit I aim at in these Papers: And therefore have (as much as might be) avoided over-nice <hi>Distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions</hi> and curious <hi>Speculations,</hi> endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring only to fortifie the Vulgar by <hi>Plain Scripture Arguments</hi> in the most ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary Heads of Christian Doctrin, and especially such as at this Day are most like to be Controverted; and at the same Time to persuade them to the Serious Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of Holiness and Righteousness, which is the <hi>Life</hi> of all Religion.</p>
            <p>To this Purpose I thought such a small <hi>Manual,</hi> Collection, or what else you please to call it, might in some respects be <hi>more Æ²seful</hi> (because more diffusive) than larger and more <hi>Elaborate Tracts.</hi> I do not pretend to have said all that might be brought for the strenthening of each Point handled (that would have swelled the Work too big, for the End I designed it) but only to offer at one View so much
<pb facs="tcp:208153:3"/>as may (by God's Blessing) be sufficient to furnish the meaner Rank of Christians, with a true Notion of that Religion they profess; that so they may not be easily shaken from their most Holy Faith by the Sophistry of any insinuating Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tensions.</p>
            <p>Wheresoever I have been Mistaken, I beseech the God of Truth to rectifie the <hi>Error</hi> both in my self, and to discover it to the Readers; withal vouchsafing them that Spirit of Charity as to excuse it, as the Frailty of a Weak Man, encom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passed with many Infirmities: But where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in I have asserted Divine Truth, I do passionately intreat all Perusers to be so kind to their own Souls, as to <hi>Own, Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace, Hold-fast</hi> and <hi>Improve</hi> it in their Lives and Conversations.</p>

               </p>
               <p n="2">II. The <hi>Natural</hi> is either, <hi>Implanted,</hi> or <hi>Acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.</hi> The <hi>Implanted</hi> consists in those <hi>inbred Notions</hi> and Principles which God endued man with at his Creation, of which St. <hi>Paul</hi> speaks, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.19. <hi>That which may be known of God is manifest in them; for God hath shewed it unto them.</hi> And this is call'd, <hi>The Law written in our hearts,</hi> Rom. 2.15. The <hi>Acquired,</hi> is gain'd by Contemplation on the <hi>works</hi> of God, and experience of his Providence: <hi>For the invisible things of him from the creation of the world are clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made, even his eternal power and Godhead; so that they are without excuse,</hi> Rom. 1.20.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Principles</hi> of both these are <hi>true,</hi> so that Man might from thence deduce true Conclusions; yet from the Begining, even before the <hi>Fall,</hi> they were not perfect in all degrees, but rather <hi>begun,</hi> and capable afterwards from time to time to be augmented and <hi>improved,</hi> partly by larger Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munications, and partly by <hi>Æ²se</hi> and <hi>Experience.</hi> But in Man <hi>since the Fall,</hi> both those ways of Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge are so <hi>weakned</hi> and corrupted, that by those Principles <hi>alone,</hi> he can neither come to know the true God after a true and sufficient manner, nor yet to live well, or dye with assurance of happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness. And therefore in vain did the old <hi>Philosophers,</hi> and wisest Heathens, from this Light of Nature,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:208153:7"/>endeavour to raise a Scheme of Religion: For as the Apostle tells us, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.21. <hi>They became vain in their imaginations, and their foolish heart was dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.</hi> This Natural Divinity will convince every considerate man, that there is <hi>a most pure, excellent, all-wise, all-powerful first Cause, Maker and Governor of himself, and all other Creatures, whom therefore he ought to Love above all things, and continually to serve and worship:</hi> And will also convince him, that he <hi>vastly comes short of his duty</hi> therein, and so, as the Apostle speaks, will <hi>render him without excuse:</hi> But it will not shew him <hi>a way</hi> or means how to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply those Failures, atone the wrath due to his dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience, or to be reconcil'd to the Lord his Maker.</p>
               <p n="3">III. <hi>Supernatural Theology,</hi> communicated to men, is to be considered in a twofold respect, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the twofold state of Man, <hi>viz.</hi> of <hi>Integrity,</hi> and of the <hi>Fall.</hi> In the state of Innocen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, it was the Will of God signified by Promises and threatnings, for the continuing of that Grace bestow'd upon Man in and by his Creation, if he should continue in his obedience. But in the state since the Fall, Supernatural Divinity is the wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of knowing God in Christ, according as it is revealed in the written Word, and may thus be defined.</p>
               <p>Theology <hi>is the wisdom of Divine things according to the Truth of God, inspired by God, and by the Enun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciative Word, in Christ, committed to the Servants of
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:208153:8"/>God, comprehended in the Books of the Old and New Testament, as far forth as is expedient for the Glory of God, and the Salv tion of the Church.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">IV. Thus there is a twofold Principle of Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity; the one, by which <hi>it is,</hi> and that is God; the other, by which it is <hi>known,</hi> and that is, <hi>THE WORD OF GOD,</hi> out of which all the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts of Divinity are to be concluded, as being the Supreme <hi>Rule of our Belief and Practice.</hi> John 20.31. <hi>These things are written, that ye might believe.</hi> Rom. 15.4. <hi>What things are written, are written for our learning; that through patience and comfort of the Scriptures we might have hope.</hi> 2 Cor. 10, 11. <hi>These things are written to admonish us.</hi> Isa. 8.20. <hi>To the Law, to the Testimony.</hi> John. 5.39. <hi>Search the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures.âthey are they that testify of me.</hi> 2 Tim. 3.15, 16, 17. <hi>They are able to make us wise unto salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, through Faith which is in Christ: For all Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture is given by Inspiration of God, and is profitable for Doctrine, for Reproof, for Correction, for Instruction in Righteousness, that the Man of God may be perfect, throughly furnisht unto every good work.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">V. 'Tis an unquestionable Principle amongst all Christians, That the Holy Scripture is both of <hi>Divine Original and Authority;</hi> and therefore very unbeseeming any that professes himself a Christian; to demand whether the Bible be <hi>the Word of God</hi> or not: For as in the <hi>Schools,</hi> there is no disputing with him who denies Principles, so we account him unworthy of the <hi>Christian Name,</hi> that shall deny
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:208153:8"/>this Principle of the Christian Religion; yet it is lawful amongst Christians to ask, <hi>By what Testimony do we know, that the Scriptures are of Divine Inspira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion?</hi> So we ask not to seduce others, or to cavil, but only to be instructed.</p>
               <p>Now this Testimony is twofold:
<list>
                     <item>The one Principal,</item>
                     <item>The other Ministerial.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p n="6">VI. The principal Testimony of the Scriptures Divine Original and Authority, is that of the <hi>Holy Spirit;</hi> both outwardly in the Scripture it self, and <hi>Inwardly</hi> in the minds and hearts of the faithful, being illuminated by him, speaking and persuading the Divinity of the Scriptures.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Outwardly</hi> in the Scriptures themselves; the Holy Ghost when he speaks of their Original and Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, uses such Phrases as attest it to be Divine, asâ<hi>The Word of the Lord. Thus saith the Lord. Jesus said. All Scripture is of Divine Inspiration. Holy Men of old, spake as they were moved by the Holy Ghost,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Inwardly</hi> in the Hearts of the faithful; the same Holy Spirit persuades the Divinity of Scriptures so far, as he openeth the Eyes, and illuminateth the mind of him that reads the same with Prayer and Humility, that he makes him see the Wonders of God, and feel it sometimes sharper than a two-edg'd Sword, dividing the <hi>Bones and the Marrow;</hi> at other times more Soveraign than <hi>Balm of Gilead,</hi> to heal his wounded Spirit, and revive his droop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Heart, causing him to acknowledge the voice
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:208153:9"/>of the Divine Majesty sounding in the Word: For as we know a man when he speaks to us, much more may we know God when he is pleased to speak unto usâ<hi>Non vox hominem sonat.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now that the Testimony of God's Spirit is <hi>that</hi> which principally and most firmly assures us of the Scriptures Divinity, is proved by these following Argumenrs.</p>
               <p n="1">1. His Testimony concerning the Scriptures is most <hi>firm,</hi> by whose Inspiration the same were written; for every one knows his <hi>own hand</hi> best, and is best acquainted with his own style: But the Scriptures were all written by the Inspiration of the Holy Ghost, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.16. 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.21. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. He that together with the Scripture is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised in a most near Conjunction to the Faithful, his Testimony of the Scripture is most firm: But the Holy Ghost is promised to the Faithful in a most near Conjunction with the Scripture. <hi>Isa.</hi> 59.21. <hi>My spirit which is in thee, and my words which I have put in thy mouth shall not depart from thee.</hi> Therefore, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. Without whose Illumination, the wonders of the Scriptures are not seen, <hi>his</hi> Testimony alone of the Scripture is most firm; as he can best declare the worth of a Casket, and the Riches therein contained, that keeps the <hi>Key</hi> of it: But without the Illumination of the Holy Ghost, no man sees the wonders of the Scripture, <hi>Psal.</hi> 119.18. <hi>Open my eyes, that I may see the wonders of thy Law.</hi> Therefore, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="7">
                  <pb n="7" facs="tcp:208153:9"/>VII. The <hi>Ministerial</hi> Testimony is the Voice or Attestation of the Universal Church; as well the several primitive Churches which first received those sacred Oracles from the inspired Writers, and after delivered them under the same Title to their Successors, and other Churches, as of all other true Christians since until these Times, for as many as have profess'd the Christian Religion, have also profess'd that these <hi>Books are of God;</hi> which Testimony ought reverently to be received, and is of great weight and importance, as being profitable to prepare the Heart, and raising an <hi>Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storical</hi> Faith, makes room for that which is <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine;</hi> the same being of all humane Testimonies (whereby the Author of any Book that hath been, is, or shall be extant, can be proved) the <hi>greatest</hi> both in respect of the <hi>Multitude, Wisdom, Honesty</hi> and <hi>Faithfulness</hi> of the Witnesses, and the <hi>Likeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood Constancy</hi> and <hi>Continuance</hi> of the Testimony it self.</p>
               <p>Yet doth not the <hi>Authority of the Scriptures</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend thereon, for that were to make the words of the Master, to receive their Authority from the Servant; a Father s Letters to receive Credit with his Son, meerly from the Foot-Post that brings them; and the Rule, to have its dependence on the thing Ruled.</p>
               <p>We know that the Oracles of God are commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the Church, and do acknowledge that She is <hi>the pillar and ground of truth,</hi> 1 Tim. 3.15. But the Candle receives not its light from the Candlestick
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:208153:10"/>that supports or holds it forth. The Churches Testimony may be inviting and prevalent with those who as yet know not the Scriptures, and have not received that <hi>sincere Milk of the Word,</hi> so as <hi>to grow thereby,</hi> 1 Pet. 2.2. In which Sense, that fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Saying of St. <hi>Augustine</hi> is to be understood, <hi>I had not known the Scriptures, if the Church had not told me which were the Scriptures.</hi> But in those who have tasted the sweetness of this Celestial Manna, the Testimony of the Scriptures themselves, and of the Holy Ghost, is most firm and effectual: For as he that tasteth Honey himself, hath a more sure knowledge of its sweetness, than he that believeth another speaking and witnessing of it; so he know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth more assuredly the Scriptures to be God's Word, who has felt its Divine Power on his own Soul, than he who only gives Credit to the Church attesting the same. The <hi>Samaritans</hi> at first be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved the Woman when she spake of Christ, but after they had heard Christ himself, they tell her, <hi>Now we believe, not because of thy saying: for we have heard him our selves, and KNOW that this is indeed the Christ, the Saviour of the world,</hi> John 4.42. Even so, he that having begd the assistance of God's Spirit, reads the Scriptures humbly and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentively, shall at length come to say, Now I believe no longer upon the Churches Testimony that the Scriptures are Divine, but because I have read them my self, and in Reading have impress'd this following unanswerable Syllogism on my mind, <hi>viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:208153:10"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>That Scripture, which</hi> (1st) <hi>brings in God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self everywhere speaking as its Author,</hi> (2dly) <hi>which is written by those Men, as being furnisht with the Gift of Prophecying and Miracles from God extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily, do with such faithfulness Record all things, that in rehearsing of sins and infirmities, they neither spare themselves nor Friends;</hi> (3dly) <hi>which records not only Truths, and all things agreeing with right Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, but Divine matters also, and such as transcend all Reason;</hi> (4thly) <hi>after a Divine manner, and in a wonderful harmony of Circumstances in the same things recited by different Writers living in remote Ages each from other;</hi> (5thly) <hi>all to the Glory of God alone, and our Salvation;</hi> (6thly) <hi>with admirable Efficacy both in moving the hearts of such as read it, and strengthning them against the greatest Afflictions, and most exquisite Tortures; so that</hi> (7thly) <hi>it has been witnessed unto by innumerable Martyrs, and</hi> (8thly) <hi>as above all other Books it most encourageth Virtue, Piety, and the good of each particular Man, as well as of Humane Society in general, and</hi> (9thly) <hi>is the most ancient Book in the world, so</hi> (lastly) <hi>beyond any Writing that ever was, it has been miraculously pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served against Diabolical and Tyranical Furyâ That Scripture (I say) which thus delivereth such things, and is thus circumstanced, must needs be Divine both in its Original and Authority.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But such is the Holy Scripture, commonly and by way of excellence, call'd THE BIBLE; Therefore it is undoubtedly Divine.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:208153:11"/>
               <p>In brief, the Testimony of the Church, is first in respect of <hi>Time,</hi> but that of the Holy Ghost is first in regard of <hi>Nature</hi> and <hi>Efficacy.</hi> We believe the Church, but not for the Church; but we believe the Holy Ghost for himself. The Churches Testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny doth monstrate, point out, and shew the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures to be Divine, but is not able, being it self but Humane, to demonstrate, or infallibly convince us thereof, or work in us a Divine Faith that they are so. The suasive Power is in the Church, but the persuasive effectual Power is the Spirit's only. The Churches Testimony begets an Opinion, but the Scripture it self, and operation of the Spirit can alone beget a firm, unshaken, holy Faith.</p>
               <p n="8">VIII. The Books of the Holy Scriptures, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the several Ages of the Church when they were given forth, are divided into those of the <hi>Old</hi> Testament, and those of the <hi>New.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Those of the Old Testament are, First, <hi>The Law,</hi> containing the <hi>Pentateuch,</hi> or Five Books of <hi>Moses,</hi> which from their respective subject matter are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers,</hi> and <hi>Deu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teronomy.</hi> Secondly, <hi>The Prophets,</hi> of which some are more <hi>Ancient,</hi> whose Books are chiefly Histori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal, as <hi>Joshua, Judges, Ruth,</hi> two Books of <hi>Samuel,</hi> and two of <hi>Kings.</hi> Others later, whereof four are call'd <hi>the greater,</hi> viz. <hi>Isaiah, Jeremy, Ezekiel,</hi> and <hi>Daniel.</hi> The other twelve, <hi>the lesser;</hi> (for Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lume, not Authority:) that is to say, <hi>Hosea, Joel, Amos, Obadiah, Jonah, Micah; Nahum, Habakkuk, Zephaniah, Haggai; Zeehariah, Malachi.</hi> Thirdly,

               </p>
               <p>Those of the New Testament are either <hi>Histori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal,</hi> containing as well the History of our blessed Christ written by the Four Evangelists, as the <hi>Acts of the Apostles</hi> by St. <hi>Luke;</hi> or <hi>dogmatical,</hi> teachative or instructing, as the several <hi>Epistles;</hi> and one <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetical,</hi> viz. the <hi>Apocalypse,</hi> or <hi>Revelation of St. John.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Having long since (when but a Child) set down for my own memory, the Names and Order of the whole 66 Canonical Books of the Old and New Testament in the following 22 Verses or Rhymes, and found the same (then) of some use for the ready turning to any Book, not knowing but it may be acceptable to others, especially Youth, to get by heart for the same purpose, I shall presume here to insert them, hoping the Reader will pardon the <hi>Æ²nevenness</hi> of the Lines, as intended only to assist him in <hi>Recollecting</hi> the place of each Book.</p>

               <p>All these Books are called <hi>Canonical,</hi> because they are the <hi>Canon,</hi> that is, the <hi>Rule,</hi> or <hi>Square</hi> of Faith and Life; nor was there ever any doubt made of their Authentickness by the Church.</p>
               <p n="9">IX. Certain other Books there are, sometimes bound up with our Bibles, that is to say, two Books of <hi>Esdras, Tobit, Judith,</hi> six Chapters added to the Book of <hi>Esther, Wisdom, Ecclesiasticus, Baruch,</hi> with the <hi>Epistle</hi> of <hi>Jeremiah,</hi> the <hi>Song</hi> of the <hi>Three Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,</hi> the <hi>Story</hi> of <hi>Susanna,</hi> the <hi>Idol Bel</hi> and the <hi>Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon,</hi> the <hi>Prayer</hi> of <hi>Manasseh,</hi> and two Books of the
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:208153:12"/>
                  <hi>Maccabees.</hi> All which, although they may be read as <hi>Ecclesiastical Histories,</hi> or excellent Tracts of <hi>Morality</hi> (as some of them are) with profit, yet they come short of that Authority which is in the <hi>Canonical Books</hi> for proving Articles of Faith: And have not been received as of Divine Authority by the ancient Church, as St. <hi>Jerome,</hi> and others of the Fathers witness; and therefore are called <hi>Apocry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pha,</hi> that is hidden, obscure, or doubtful; and by some of the Ancients <hi>Deutero-Canonici,</hi> Books of the second or lesser Canon.</p>
               <p>The Reasons assignd for not receiving these Books as Canonical, are these. First, Because they were not written by <hi>Prophets,</hi> but for the most part since <hi>Malachi</hi> the last Prophet, and since the time of the sealing of Prophecy. Secondly, Because as they are not written in the style of the Prophets, so neither in the <hi>Hebrew Tongue.</hi> Thirdly, Because they are <hi>never alledg'd</hi> in the New Testament. Fourthly, Because in them we find many passages <hi>inconsistent</hi> with Canonical Scripture, and other things fabulous and repugnant to Faith and Piety: For Example, in the Additions to <hi>Esther,</hi> what is said in <hi>Chap.</hi> 11.2. and <hi>Chap.</hi> 12.1. in the <hi>Apocry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pha,</hi> contradicts what is said <hi>Chap.</hi> 2.16. of the Canonical. And what is said <hi>Chap.</hi> 12.5. of the <hi>Apocrypha,</hi> opposes what is delivered <hi>Chap.</hi> 6.3. in the Canonical. So in the Additions to <hi>Daniel,</hi> the Story of the Prophet <hi>Habakkuk</hi> seems false; for he prophecy'd before the <hi>Babylonish</hi> Captivity, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears by his own Prophecy; and if he were then living, he must have prophecy'd more than an 100
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:208153:13"/>years, which is no ways probable. The Book of <hi>Judith,</hi> Chap. 9.2. commends what is condemn'd <hi>Gen.</hi> 34.25. and 49.5, &amp; 6. and its first and 11th contradicts each other. The Book of <hi>Wisdom, Chap.</hi> 14.5. is mistaken, and the whole supposed to be wrote by <hi>Philo</hi> the <hi>Jew,</hi> after Christ. The Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of <hi>Ecclesiasticus</hi> complements, and <hi>begs pardon</hi> in his Prologue, which inspired Writers never did, nor have reason to do. In the 2d Book of <hi>Macca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bees,</hi> sacrificing for the <hi>Dead,</hi> and <hi>those</hi> too that died in Idolatry and Sacriledge, is commended; and at other places Self-Murther is encouraged.</p>
               <p>For all which Reasons, as these <hi>Apocryphal</hi> Books were never received by the <hi>Jews,</hi> so neither by the <hi>ancient Christians,</hi> but forbidden by some to be read in the Church, if we may credit the Author of the Exposition of the Creed in <hi>Cyprian,</hi> or the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of <hi>Laodicea;</hi> however our <hi>Mother the Church of England,</hi> conserving in this, as in other things, her accustomed <hi>Moderation,</hi> does, with St. <hi>Hierome,</hi> ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit them to <hi>be read,</hi> and some of them even in the Church, for example of Life, and instruction of Manners, yet does not acknowledge the same to be Canonical.</p>
               <p n="10">X. <hi>The Holy Scriptures contain all things</hi> necessary to Salvation, <hi>so that whatsoever is not read therein, or may be proved thereby, is not to be required of any man, that it should be believed as an Article of Faith, or be thought requisite or necessary to salvation.</hi> [Articles of the Church of England, <hi>Art.</hi> 6.] <hi>The Church hath Power to decree Rites and Ceremonies, and Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:208153:13"/>in Controversies of Faith: And yet it is not law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful for the Church to ordain any thing that is contrary to God's Word written: Neither may it so expound one place of Scripture, that it be repugnant to another; wherefore although the Church be a Witness, and a Keeper of Holy Writ, yet as it ought not to decree any thing</hi> against <hi>the same, so</hi> besides <hi>the same, ought it not to inforce any thing to be believed for necessity of salvation,</hi> [Ibid.

                     <p>The Apostle speaks either of some free and <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different</hi> Constitutions concerning the Order and <hi>Decorum</hi> of the Church, or of that <hi>Doctrin</hi> which he had preached to them by word of mouth, and which is contained in his, and other Canonical Writings; so that this either way makes nothing for <hi>other Traditions</hi> obtruded as necessary to Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion either contrary to the Scriptures, or not in some part thereof comprehended.</p>

The Holy Scriptures being the foveraign and <hi>perfect Rule</hi> of the Christian Religion, it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows that the <hi>reading</hi> and study thereof is highly expedient for <hi>all Christians,</hi> and accordingly the same is enjoin'dâ<hi>Search the Scriptures,</hi> Joh. 5.39. <hi>Let the Word of God dwell plenteously amongst you, Col.</hi> 3.16.</p>
                     <p n="12">XII. Hence also it follows, That the <hi>Translation</hi> of the Bible into <hi>vulgar Tongues</hi> is both <hi>lawful</hi> and <hi>necessary,</hi> which are so far <hi>authentical</hi> as they agree with the Original Fountains, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Hebrew</hi> in the Old Testament, and the <hi>Greek</hi> in the New.</p>
                     <p>The Reasons hereof are, (1.) Because the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets and Apostles preached their Doctrins to the People, and Nations in their own Languages, <hi>Jer.</hi> 36.15. <hi>Acts</hi> 2.6. (2dly) Because soon after the Apostles times, many <hi>Translations</hi> were extant. (3dly) Because all things must be done in the Church <hi>unto edifying,</hi> 1 Cor. 14.26. But an <hi>unknown</hi> Tongue doth not edifie, but tends to <hi>confusion,</hi> Gen. 11.7.</p>
                     <p n="13">XIII. Nor is there any <hi>such Obscurity</hi> in these sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Oracles, as may or ought to discourage any from the study of them, but that they may thence reap great benefit and advantage; for the <hi>plainness</hi> of the Scripture is to be considered, either in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of <hi>it self,</hi> or in respect of <hi>men.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="1">1. In respect of <hi>it self,</hi> though its matter con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain most <hi>deep mysteries</hi> hidden from Ages, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:208153:15"/>from the natural capacity of man, yet they are clearly enough there proposed and explained. And as its internal Form, being <hi>Divine Truth,</hi> can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not in it self be obscure, seeing it is that <hi>light</hi> which illuminates our mind; so for its external Form or <hi>Style,</hi> although in some places it be temper'd with words and phrases somewhat <hi>obscure,</hi> yet elsewhere, and for the most part it is sufficiently clear and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spicuous; the Holy Spirit so adapting its style, that neither its <hi>Plainness</hi> should occasion <hi>Contempt,</hi> nor its <hi>Difficulty</hi> render the Text <hi>unprofitable.</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore what in <hi>one</hi> place is clearly taught, in another is coucht in <hi>Parables,</hi> or more abstruse words and phrases, thereby at once quickning our <hi>diligence,</hi> in searching and confounding the <hi>pride</hi> of Humane Wit; as also that we should both more ardently <hi>beg of God</hi> the Gift of understanding, and with the greater <hi>Industry</hi> apply our selves to dig up this trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of heavenly wisdom.</p>

<pb n="20" facs="tcp:208153:16"/>either be ignorant of them without hazard of Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, or else in some other place of the Bible they are more clearly set forth: So that all Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrins <hi>necessary</hi> to be known, believed and obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved for salvation, are in their places so clearly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed and delivered, that every man, though never so <hi>mean</hi> or Plebeian, doing his duty by Prayer, Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility, and making use of the ordinary means for finding out the sense of Scriptures, may easily and <hi>sufficiently,</hi> to his salvation, come to understand them.</p>
                     <p n="14">XIV. The Scriptures consist not so much in the <hi>bare words,</hi> as in the <hi>sense</hi> and meaning of the words, which is their <hi>internal Form;</hi> therefore in the first place the genuine sense of the Holy Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture is to be sought out by a <hi>due Interpretation,</hi> which is nothing else but <hi>an explanation of the true sense of the words, and a fit application thereof, for Doctrin, for Reproof, for Correction, for Instruction in Righteousness,</hi> 2 Tim. 3.16.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>true sense</hi> of Scripture is <hi>that</hi> which results, and is immediately gather'd from the words and phrases rightly understood, and which the Speakers <hi>intention</hi> and <hi>nature of the thing</hi> do import.</p>
                     <p>Ths sense is not various or <hi>manifold,</hi> but <hi>one,</hi> to wit, <hi>Grammatical</hi> or Literal, which the words, whether <hi>properly</hi> or <hi>figuratively</hi> taken, do of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves bear: For words and phrases are to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood either <hi>properly</hi> or <hi>figuratively,</hi> and by a <hi>Trope,</hi> when the words properly taken would produce some manifest <hi>absurdity,</hi> or argue <hi>falshood;</hi> as the
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:208153:16"/>sense of that saying, <hi>The Seed of the Woman shall bruise the Serpents Head,</hi> is this, That Christ shall defeat and subdue the <hi>Devil,</hi> and his greatest de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signs; though properly the Devil is not a <hi>Serpent,</hi> and being a <hi>Spirit</hi> can have <hi>no Head;</hi> so when we read of <hi>the Arm of the Lord,</hi> the literal sense is not, that God hath such a Member, but that which is signified by that Member, to wit, <hi>strength,</hi> and operative <hi>vertue.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The other <hi>three</hi> senses which some reckon up, and call them spiritual or mystical, <hi>viz. Allegorical, Anagogical,</hi> and <hi>Tropological,</hi> are not divers distinct senses of Holy Scripture, but only divers <hi>manners</hi> of handling Scripture, or various accomodations of its only true literal sense: For,</p>
                     <p n="1">1. The <hi>Allegorical</hi> Interpretation is the applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the literal sense to <hi>Christ,</hi> or the <hi>Church,</hi> by some similitude; as to say <hi>David</hi> was a Type of Christ, and <hi>Goliah</hi> of the Devil; therefore <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi>'s Fight and Victory, signifies Christ's Combat with and Conquest of the Devil: Or <hi>David</hi> over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came <hi>Goliah,</hi> therefore the Faithful shall in the end surmount all Afflictions. Now this is not a <hi>new sense,</hi> but only an application of that History; and though sometimes such <hi>Allegories</hi> may profitably be raised, yet we must use them sparingly and soberly: For it is dangerous to indulge our Fancies too far that way, as appears by some of the ancient Fathers, particularly the great St. <hi>Origen,</hi> who thereby fell into several Errors, and obscured the Truth, and perverted the Sense of Holy Scripture, by over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bold and frequent <hi>Allegorizing.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">
                        <pb n="22" facs="tcp:208153:17"/>2. The <hi>Anagogical</hi> Interpretation is indeed but a <hi>species</hi> of the Allegorical, whereby some <hi>Type</hi> of the Old Testament is applied to the Truth exhibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the New, or the <hi>Glory</hi> of the Life to come is signified by things known and obvious to the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses; as <hi>Psal.</hi> 95.11. <hi>I sware in my wrath that they should not enter into my rest.</hi> Here <hi>Rest</hi> signifies in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed <hi>the Land of Canaan,</hi> but Anagogically taken, <hi>Eternal Bliss,</hi> because <hi>Canaan</hi> was thereof a <hi>Type.</hi> So the Glory of Heaven is painted out in the <hi>Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations,</hi> by the similitude of a most beautiful <hi>City;</hi> yet still here is no double sense, but an Anagogical application, whereby we refer the <hi>sign</hi> to the <hi>thing signified.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="3">3. The like may be said of the <hi>Tropological</hi> sense, which is but an efficacious transferring of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, when from some <hi>Fact</hi> there recorded, we col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect some Doctrin of <hi>Morality,</hi> or wholesom In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structions of life, as St. <hi>Paul,</hi> 1 Cor. 9.9. from that Text of <hi>Deut.</hi> 25.4. <hi>Thou shalt not muzzle the mouth of the Ox that treadeth out the Corn;</hi> raises an Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, That Christians ought to allow a fit mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance to their <hi>Ministers.</hi>

                     <p n="15">XV. Although the Interpretation of Scripture be committed to the <hi>Church,</hi> yet the only <hi>Supreme Judge</hi> of this Interpretation, is the <hi>Holy Ghost speaking in it,</hi> who is the Sovereign Interpreter and Judge of Controversies.</p>

                  <head>THE PROOF.</head>
                  <p>In such a Judge four Things are requisite: First, That he <hi>cannot Err.</hi> Secondly, That there lie no <hi>Appeal</hi> from him. Thirdly, That he be not <hi>par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial,</hi> much less a Party in the Dispute. Fourthly, That he be able to enforce <hi>Obedience;</hi> which Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience being <hi>spiritual,</hi> and consisting in the <hi>Will,</hi> none but God can enforce it: Therefore since no man, or number of men, can justly or modestly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to any one of these qualifications, they ought to renounce their Claim of Sovereign Judicature, and yield the same to the blessed Spirit, whose alone Right it is upon all those four Accounts.</p>
                  <p>True it is, there are others that may be call'd subordinate and inferior <hi>Judges</hi> of Interpretation and Controversy, as the ancient <hi>Fathers</hi> of the Church, or the <hi>Bishops</hi> of the present Age, whether in a <hi>General Council,</hi> (if that were possible) or a National <hi>Synod</hi> or <hi>Convocation</hi> assembled, to whose Judgments for Peace, Humility, and Unity, we ought always to pay a reverend Esteem, and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to, and acquiesce therein, where not forbidden by <hi>Scripture.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But still all these have a <hi>Judge above them,</hi> viz. The <hi>Scripture it self,</hi> or Holy Ghost speaking there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in; for their Judgment is not therefore <hi>true,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they do so adjudge, but because they judge ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the <hi>Word,</hi> for otherwise they may err. The Holy Spirit is the Supreme Interpreter, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause by him we must be enlightned before we can
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:208153:18"/>obtain the true sense of Scripture, otherwise we shall never reach that <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, or <hi>full assurance</hi> of Faith, which the Apostle speaks of. Now this is that internal Persuasion which extends only to our selves, for we cannot thereby work upon <hi>others</hi> to make them receive the sense and judgment of the Spirit: And therefore secondly, The Holy Spirit speaking in the Scriptures, is also the Soveraign Interpreter and Judge in respect of <hi>external</hi> Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suasion, and therefore that we may persuade others, we must bring them to this external judgment of the Scripture: For,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>That which alone has Power to beget</hi> Faith, <hi>has alone the Supreme Power of interpreting of Scriptures, and determining all Controversies of Faith: But only the Scriptures, together with the Holy Spirit, have that Power.</hi> Ergo, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                     <pb n="25" facs="tcp:208153:18"/>which if not observed, we shall be in danger of erring, since they Answer to, and Remedy so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny several Impediments, which we are apt to be Subject unto.</p>

                     <hi>Rules to be observed before Reading the Holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, are</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. That we apply our selves to <hi>Prayer,</hi> which is both Commanded, and Success promised to it, <hi>Matth.</hi> 7.7. <hi>Jam.</hi> 1.5. We must Implore the As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance of the <hi>Holy Ghost,</hi> without whose Illumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation we shall not be able to understand the Scriptures, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2.27. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.12.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. We ought to renounce our own Carnal Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and humane Reasonings, and resolve to hearken to God alone, teaching us in his <hi>Word,</hi> and to bring down all our Cogitations to the Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience of <hi>Christ:</hi> For nothing hinders proficiency in Divine things, more than a vain opinion of our own Wisdom, <hi>Matth.</hi> 11.27. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.7. and <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.18, 19.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. We should approach the Scriptures without prejudice and unbias'd, with a pure, candid mind, simply desirous to Learn; a prejudicate opinion is a very great hinderance; Therefore Christ bids his Disciples, Beware of the <hi>Leven of the Pharisees,</hi> and St. <hi>Paul</hi> advises, â <hi>Beware left any Man spoil you through Philosophy, and vain deceit, after the Tradition of Men, after the Rudiments of the World, and not after Christ,</hi> Coloss. 2.8.</p>
                  <p n="4">
                     <pb n="26" facs="tcp:208153:19"/>4. We must come with a mind purg'd by <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Repentance,</hi> and truly studious of <hi>Piety,</hi> for the pure Spirit of Christ that Enlightneth the mind, will not dwell in the Impenitent and Prophane, 2. <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.7.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. We must come with a Reverend and hearty <hi>Love</hi> of Truth, and an ardent desire of receiving and retaining it. Hence those who read the Holy Scriptures only <hi>formally,</hi> and out of Custom, or for <hi>ill ends,</hi> as for Ostentation, Vain-Glory, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, or the like, attain not the meaning of the Holy Spirit, 2 <hi>Thess.</hi> 2.11.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. We must come not only with a desire to <hi>know</hi> the Will of God, but also with a Resolution to <hi>do it;</hi> for the end of Scripture is not bare knowledge, but joyn'd with <hi>practice, Tit.</hi> 2.12.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The Rules to be observed in the Interpreting of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, are</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. We should endeavour to understand the <hi>very Words,</hi> which the Holy Ghost has used in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; and therefore (if our Circumstances will permit) should strive to be acquainted with the <hi>Original Tongues,</hi> for therein things are delivered with a greater <hi>Emphasis,</hi> and they are very great helps: But the unlearned must serve themselves of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#murp" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>â¢â¢</desc>
                     </gap>e best Translations, and the Interpretations of Godly Learned <hi>Divines,</hi> delivered in their Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings or Writings.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. We must diligently weigh each Word, that we may distinguish those that are used <hi>properly,</hi> from
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:208153:19"/>such as are put <hi>figuratively,</hi> and know their most usu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al and more proper Significations; for Figura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Expressions are not to be Interpreted proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, nor the contrary.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. We must take notice of the Principal Intent, or <hi>main Scope,</hi> and end of each place, which is to be gather'd as well out of the matter foregoing, as following.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. All the <hi>Circumstances</hi> of the place proposed are to be Considered (as <hi>Time, Place, Person,</hi> &amp;c.) and also the words precedent and subsequent: If a word be capable of diverse senses, we must see by those Circumstances in which Signification it may <hi>here</hi> most aptly be taken.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Compare one place with another, the more <hi>obscure</hi> with those that are more clear: and not only like Texts with like, but also unlike Texts with unlike.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. The Phrases usual to the Scripture are to be considered and heeded, especially the <hi>Hebraisms,</hi> which also frequently occur in the <hi>New Testament;</hi> their sense is to be inquired into either from the <hi>Hebrew Language,</hi> or the Comments of Learned Men.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. <hi>Allegories</hi> are not to be raised and Expound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed according to every ones Fancy, but from the circumstances of the places whence they are drawn, and other Texts.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. In Interpreting of Scriptures we ought as much as may be, contain our selves within their own Bounds and Terms, both real and verbal. <hi>I have taught you Statutes and Judgments, even as the
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:208153:20"/>Lord my God Commanded me,</hi> saith <hi>Moses,</hi> Deut. 4.5. <hi>Just so,</hi> altered neither in <hi>Words</hi> nor <hi>Matter.</hi> If any Man teach otherwise, and consent not to <hi>Wholsome words, the words of the Lord Jesus Christ, and to the Doctrin which is according to Godliness, He is Proud, knowing nothing, but doting about Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stions and Strifes of Words,</hi> &amp;c. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.3.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. VVe ought to consult the best and most sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere <hi>Interpreters, Acts</hi> 8.21. and <hi>Chap.</hi> 10.15. But still so as not to Envassal our Understandings to their Dictates, but remembring that as <hi>Men</hi> they may <hi>Err:</hi> And tho they are our <hi>Guides,</hi> yet are not <hi>Lords</hi> of our <hi>Faith.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="10">10. As the Holy Scripture is the Fountain and Lively <hi>Spring,</hi> containing in all Sufficiency and Abundance, the pure <hi>Water of Life;</hi> and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever is necessary to make Gods People wise unto Salvation: so the constant and unanimous Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of the true Church of Christ, in the Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Ages thereof, is (as it were) a <hi>Conduit-Pipe</hi> to Derive and Convey to succeeding Generations, the Celestial VVater contained in Scripture; the first of these, namely the Scripture, is of Soveraign Authority; and for it self, <hi>Worthy of all Accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:</hi> The latter, namely the Voice and Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of the Primitive Church, is a Ministerial and Subordinate Rule and Guide, to preserve and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect us in the Right understanding of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.

                  <p>Lastly, In all Interpretations we are to have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to the <hi>Analogy of Faith,</hi> that is, the General and Perpetual Tenour and Sentence of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures in plain places, such as are the Articles thence deduc'd and summ'd up in the <hi>Creed,</hi> the <hi>Lords Prayer,</hi> and the <hi>Decalogue,</hi> (or Ten Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments) and the main Principles of the <hi>Christian Religion,</hi> as to give <hi>all Glory to God,</hi> to promote <hi>self-denial</hi> and <hi>Humility;</hi> to Advance <hi>Charity, Peace and the Good of Mankind,</hi> &amp;c. VVhatever Comment violates these, must needs be false. Nor must we Interpret an obscure place so as to render the sense thereof contrary to that of another clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er place, for there are no real Incoherences or Contradictions in the <hi>Book of God,</hi> whatever may seem to our weak apprehensions.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The Rules to be observed after we have sound out the true meaning of any Scripture, are three,</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. Giving of Thanks for the greatness of the Mercy and Benefit, that the Lord has been pleas'd in any measure to vouchsafe us the knowledge of his Divine Will and Heavenly Misteries: For God to punish Mans Ingratitude does often times either deprive him of the Knowledge before given him, or at least does not encrease it.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The Word understood is to be Meditated up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and fixt in the Memory, <hi>Psal.</hi> 1.2. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.15. VVithout this, your Knowledge will soon de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cay and vanish, as a Nail is easily pull'd out, if it be not clenched.</p>
                  <p n="3">
                     <pb n="30" facs="tcp:208153:21"/>3. Your Knowledge must be improved to Piety, and what you read and understand, accomodated to Use and Practice, whether Commands, or Prohibiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, Exhortations, Promises or Consolations, all must tend to the Strenghning your Faith, and render<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing your Life and Conversation more Righteous, Humble, Charitable and Holy, since this is the great end of the Scripture, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.23. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.11. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.16. Those that do otherwise, by the just Judgment of God fall from the Truth: To such God threatens to take away his Gospel; to send upon them a Famine, not of Bread, but of his Word, <hi>Amos</hi> 8.11. And to remove their Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dlestick, <hi>Rev.</hi> 2.5. A <hi>bad Heart</hi> will weaken the best <hi>Head,</hi> and <hi>Depravity</hi> of <hi>Manners</hi> is oftimes punished with <hi>Blindness</hi> of Understanding.</p>

               </head>
               <p n="1">I. AS <hi>God</hi> is the proper and prime <hi>Object,</hi> so he is also the Principal and Supream <hi>End</hi> of <hi>Divinity:</hi> And therefore since the Chief End, and the <hi>Chief Good,</hi> are one and the same thing, it is manifest, That <hi>Christian Divinity</hi> alone doth rightly teach us concerning the <hi>Chief Good.</hi> The Subordinate end of <hi>Divinity</hi> is our <hi>Salvation,</hi> which consisteth in the Union and Fruition of <hi>God. This is Life Eternal to know Thee the true God, and Jesus Christ whom thou hast sent,</hi> Joh. 17.3.</p>
               <p n="2">II. He that cometh to God, must first believe that he <hi>is, Hebr.</hi> 11.6.</p>
               <div type="reasons">
                  <head>Some of the Reasons proving that there is <hi>a God,</hi> are these:</head>
                  <p n="1">1. By the <hi>Motion</hi> of things, we gather there must be a first Mover. 2. Nothing can be the <hi>Cause</hi> of it self, for then it should be both the Cause and the Effect, and be both <hi>before</hi> and <hi>after</hi> it self,
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:208153:23"/>which is absurd; therefore all things have their beginning from one first and supreme Cause, which is <hi>God;</hi> And those that will call it <hi>Nature,</hi> do not differ from this Notion of that more excellent and perfect. Being, but only change its <hi>Name,</hi> and rather shew, they have a vain mistaken Ambition of being <hi>thought Atheists,</hi> than that they have any Reason strong enough to convince them to be so. 3ly. Since all things whatsoever, even those with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Life, Sense, and Reason, which cannot move voluntarily or intend an End, are yet directed Orderly to some certain <hi>End;</hi> It follows there must be one Wise, Good and Chief <hi>Directer,</hi> or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering and guiding all things, not only to their particular Ends, but also to some one Supream End, <hi>Prov.</hi> 16.4. 4ly. From those degrees of Entity, Truth, and Goodness, which we undeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably find in the Creatures; we Collect, That there must be one Chief Entity, Truth, Goodness, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 5ly. The Apprehension of a Deity is Innate and <hi>Connatural</hi> with Man; Never was Nation so Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous but they gave Testimony to this Truth, and rather than be without a <hi>God,</hi> would fain to themselves <hi>ridiculous Deities;</hi> nay such as have studied to become <hi>Atheists,</hi> could never totally blot this Truth out of their Consciences, but the Majesty of God hath Affrighted, and his Terrors made them astonisht, in a Storm of <hi>Thunder,</hi> a Tempest <hi>at Sea,</hi> any great Calamity, or when they came to <hi>Die.</hi> 6ly. Miracles and the Signifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of things to come, which by no Humane foresight, or Power or Natural Signs and Causes
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:208153:23"/>could either be affected or discovered, may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince that there is an Infinite Power that is above, and doth over-rule and Dispose of all things. This is <hi>Tullies</hi> Argument, <hi>Si est Divinatio, sunt Dii:</hi> If you grant <hi>Divination,</hi> you must needs ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge a <hi>Deity.</hi> 7ly. The extraordinary Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidences, as Revolutions of States, overthrow of Kingdoms, protection of Princes, discovery and punishment of secret Treasons, Murther, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible Judgments on notorious sinners, and preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of good men, and especially of the Church, are so many demonstrations of that Sovereign Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice which presides over all things. 8ly. The Acts of Conscience in <hi>Excusing</hi> and comforting in well-doing against all the Disgraces, Slanders and Persecutions of the World; and its <hi>Accusing</hi> and terrifying for sins secretly committed, which ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver did nor shall come to the knowledge of Men; its exciting to Holiness, and curbing from Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, are a manifest proof that there is a <hi>Supream Judge,</hi> who hath given a Law hinding the Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, doth observe all our Devices, Words and Works, and will call us to an account and reck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oning. 9ly. The beauty, harmony and order which appear in the Creatures, the wonderful Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties of mans Soul, the Lustre of the <hi>Sun,</hi> the Glory of the innumerable <hi>Stars,</hi> the Wonders of the <hi>Ocean,</hi> the Fertility of the <hi>Earth,</hi> and its variety of productions, are all illustrious Arguments both of the <hi>Being,</hi> and infinite <hi>Wisdom</hi> of the <hi>Creator.</hi> Lastly, the Holy Scriptures do most effectuall and clearly above all other means, teach and satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:208153:24"/>us, that <hi>there is a God;</hi> as all <hi>pious souls</hi> by the Renewing, Quickning and Consolation of the Holy Spirit are sensible and can testify, and are ready to suffer a thousand deaths with most exqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site Tortures, rather than deny.</p>
                  <p n="3">III. <hi>ATHEISTS</hi> are of Three sorts, 1. <hi>Practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal,</hi> such as in words acknowledg God, but in works deny him. The World, (I wish I could not say, <hi>the Church</hi>) is full of <hi>these Atheists;</hi> and they make too great a figure even amongst the first rate professors of Christianity. Their Understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings are convinc'd, but their <hi>Wills</hi> stand out in Rebellion. If men had it once throughly impress'd upon their spirits, That there was a most Holy, Just, all-seeing power that will bring all their thoughts, words and actions to Judgment; and an Eternal life of Retribution certainly to follow, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in Joy or Torment, it would seem impossible they should lead such lives as they do; the truth is, all willful sin hath this Malignity in it, that in effect it denyeth that there is a God, by denying his Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, Wisdom, Goodness, his Holiness, Truth and Justice. A Christian asking an Infidel how he could quiet his Conscience in such a desperate state? <hi>I rather wonder</hi> (reply'd the other) <hi>how you can quiet your Conscience in such a common careless course of life, believing as you do? If I believ'd such things as you profess, I should think no Care, Deligence and Holyness enough.</hi> 2dly. <hi>Pragmatical,</hi> These are a disputing, inquisitive sort of people, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they could be glad there were <hi>no God</hi> to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:208153:24"/>them, or out of vanity to seem <hi>wiser</hi> than their Neighbours, presume to question and argue against his Being that made them, tho yet in their private calm thoughts they are themselves con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinc'd of it. 3ly. <hi>Dogmatical,</hi> who do really hold and believe there is no God; such men have offer'd violence to their own Natures, razed out those notions which are born with us, and cannot arrive at so dreadful a State but through a long course of sin, which (by the Concurrence of Gods just Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in punishing thereof) deadens and scars their Consciences, and gives them utterly up to a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probate sense.</p>
                  <p n="4">IV. God being Infinite and Incomprehensible cannot be known by us, or defined as he is in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self; but two ways we do obtain some knowledge of Him, <hi>viz.</hi> Naturally, and Supernaturally; the Natural way is threefold.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. By way of <hi>Eminence,</hi> whereby we know that what perfection soever can be found in any Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, as Wisdom, Justice, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> is more Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently in God.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. By way of <hi>Negation,</hi> we know what He is not, rather than what he is; and therefore we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move from our Conceptions of God whatever Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfections we observe in the Creatures: Thus we say he is Immortal, Infinite, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. By way of <hi>Causation,</hi> by the Creatures as ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects we come to know God as the Cause, and that therefore he must needs be All-wise, most powerful, Good, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="5">
                     <pb n="38" facs="tcp:208153:25"/>V. The <hi>Supernatural</hi> way whereby we come to the knowledge of God, is by those Revelations he hath been pleas'd to make of himself in the Holy Scriptures; where we learn, <hi>That there is one only living true God, Eternal, Incorporeal, without Parts, without Passions, of infinite Power, Wisdom, and Goodness, the Creator of all things, visible and invisible, most Just and Holy, who will be a Rewarder of those that diligently seek him and obey his Laws, and punish the disobedient either here or hereafter:</hi> And that in the Unity of this Deity there are three Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons of the same Substance, Power, and Eternity, the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost, our <hi>Creator, Redeemer,</hi> and <hi>Sanctifyer.</hi>

                     <p>Repentance is Attributed to God by a Figure, call'd <hi>Anthropopathy,</hi> or speaking after the manner of men, because he did sometimes after the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of a man, repenting, as to the Effect, not as to the Affect, and the like in other Passions.</p>
                     <p n="6">VI. God has discovered his Essence in his Word Two ways, by his Names, and by his Properties.</p>
                     <p>The Names of God are taken either from his Essence, As <hi>Jehovah,</hi> and <hi>Jah</hi> (which in our English Translations is rendred Lord, and gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally put in Capitals thus, <hi>THE LORD</hi>) or from his Power, as <hi>El, Elohim;</hi> or from his All-suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency, as <hi>Shaddai,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>The Name of <hi>Jehovah</hi> is Gods chief and most proper Name, being derived from the Root <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jah,</hi> He was; thereby denoting the <hi>self-Essense</hi> of God; who, was, is, and is to come, from Eternity to Eternity, whereas all other things have their Being from him, and in time; the Name <hi>Elohim</hi> is of the plural Number, yet is a Personal, but Essen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial Name of God, spoken of one God, and of each Person; For there are not Three <hi>Elohims,</hi> but one <hi>Elohim,</hi> Psa. 7. <hi>Elohim Zaddick,</hi> the just God.</p>
                     <p n="7">VII. The divine properties are Gods <hi>Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes,</hi> by which he is pleas'd to make himself known to us weak Mortals; and is by them distinguish'd
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:208153:26"/>from the Creatures, for they are not Qualities nor Accidents, neither separable from his Essence, nor from each other.</p>
                     <p>These Attributes are either wholly <hi>Incommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable</hi> to the Creatures, or <hi>Communicable</hi> in some Analogical effects, or resemblances.</p>
                     <p>Of the first Rank, are his <hi>Simplicity,</hi> and <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finity.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Gods <hi>Simplicity</hi> is that by which he is known to be truly One, and free from all Composition.</p>
                     <p>His <hi>Infinity</hi> is that by whith he is known to be an Entity infinitely true and good, and without measure or bounds.</p>
                     <p n="8">VIII. From these Two Attributes we may ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther these Truths, 1. That God is an Entity truly and most simply <hi>One.</hi> 2dly. That there is therefore nothing in God, which is not God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self. 3ly. That Gods Essence is to us Incompre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensible; There being no proportion between an Infinite Being, and our Finite Understandings. 4ly. That God is altogether All; All in himself, all in all things, all in every thing, and all out of every thing. 5ly. That God is neither Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumscribed, nor Defined by place, not Included within it, nor Excluded without it. 6ly. That God is Eternal, that is, without Beginning, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out End, without Change.</p>
                     <p n="9">IX. The Properties of God, which are in some respects Communicable to men, are <hi>Life,</hi> or the Attribute of his Being, his <hi>Æ²nderstanding,</hi> of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:208153:27"/>his <hi>Will,</hi> of Commanding, and his <hi>Power</hi> of Executing: Whence we learn,</p>
                     <p n="1">1. That whereas the <hi>Life</hi> of God is most Sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple and Infinite, it follows, 1. That his <hi>Life</hi> and his <hi>Actual Living</hi> is all one. 2ly. That tho he hath no other <hi>Cause</hi> than himself by which he li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth, yet he is the <hi>Cause</hi> of Life in all living Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures; in respect of whom their Life is but as it were begg'd or borrow'd. 3ly. That the Life of God is most perfect, most blessed and Immutable.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Gods <hi>Æ²nderstanding</hi> being most simple and infinite, it follows, 1. That he knows all things most exquisitely, tho they are not Revealed to the Creatures. 2ly. That he knoweth all things by himself. 3dly. And that too, by one most simple Act, for he needs no Revelation, nor discourse either from the Effect, or from the Cause, or from that which is more known to that which is less known; for all things to him are alike. 4ly. Things past, and things to come, no less than things <hi>present,</hi> for such to him are all things. 5ly. His Knowledge is Infinite, therefore free from all Ignorance and Oblivion.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Whereas the Will of God is most simple, ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in him, 1. There are neither two or more, or contrary Wills; for tho there may by us be conceived diverse districtions of his Will, yet they are rather <hi>Nominal</hi> than <hi>Real.</hi> 2ly.

               <p>VVE now proceed to consider the works of God, <hi>viz.</hi> Creation and Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.</p>
               <p n="1">I. <hi>Creation</hi> is that work of God [<hi>Jehovah Elohim,</hi> the undivided Trinity] whereby accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to his Free-will by his word only, he in (or rather together with) Time, produced the world, and the things therein from Not being, into Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: Or, that Divine Efficiency whereby the <hi>World,</hi> of <hi>Nothing,</hi> was in the beginning made very good.</p>
               <p>That the World was Created, or made <hi>out of nothing</hi> appears, because there was not any thing from Eternity but <hi>God;</hi> Therefore whatever is, must be either the Creator, or a Creature: But the Creatures were not made of the Substance of
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:208153:32"/>God, for then they must be the same with God (or Gods) which is absurd; Therefore they were made of nothing. For God being Omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potent, needed not any pre-existent <hi>matter.</hi> 'Tis true, the greatest glory of the Works of Nature or Men is, if they can, when they have <hi>matter,</hi> give it a curious <hi>Fashion;</hi> but this All powerful Artist, first gave a Being to <hi>matter,</hi> then to that <hi>matter</hi> a <hi>Form,</hi> and to that Form, <hi>Beauty</hi> and <hi>Perfection.</hi> He <hi>spake, and it was done: He com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, and it was Created,</hi> Psal. 33.9. and 148.5. So <hi>Hebr.</hi> 11.3. <hi>The things that we see were mace,</hi>

                  </gap>, <hi>not of things that did appear,</hi> that is, out of no apparent matter.</p>
               <p>Yet we are to Note, That as Creation strict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and most properly taken, is the production of something immediately <hi>out of nothing,</hi> and so is to be understood, <hi>Gen.</hi> 1.1. so secondarily (and still properly too) it is said of a mediate production out of a matter, when that <hi>matter is created out of nothing,</hi> and also is in it self alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether <hi>unapt</hi> for such a production; as likewise, because the <hi>Form was immediately out of nothing,</hi> in which Sense the Word is used, <hi>Gen.</hi> 1.21. there being no aptitude or disposition in the <hi>Dust</hi> or <hi>Clay</hi> of the Earth to Man's Body, which was so miraculously produced thence. And besides the <hi>Form</hi> or <hi>Soul,</hi> which constituted him a Man, was out of nothing. These different Modes of Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion are intimated in the Sacred Text by several words; of the first it is said, <hi>Be it,</hi> or <hi>Let it be;</hi> of the second, <hi>Let it produce,</hi> or <hi>Let us make.</hi>

               <p>An infinite Arm is required to produce things out of nothing; All Beings, by participation, must be from that which has its <hi>Being of it self,</hi> which is only <hi>God.</hi> He who is without any Beginning, gave a Beginning to Time, and to the World in Time. To begin that for which there was no <hi>Pattern;</hi> Nay, no <hi>Matter,</hi> whereto there was no <hi>Inclination,</hi> and wherein was no <hi>possibility</hi> of what it should be, is proper only to the Infinite power of an Infinite Creator, who having shewn him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self able to fetch <hi>all things out of no hing,</hi> we ought not in the least to distrust him in <hi>any thing,</hi> but firmly acquiesce on his word in all our Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stresses, Believing in <hi>Hope, even against Hope in Him who calleth those things that are not, as if they were,</hi> Rom. 4.17.</p>
               <p n="3">III. There was no Accession of Perfection ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cru'd to God by creating the world; neither did he create it because he <hi>needed it,</hi> or could be <hi>bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd</hi> by it, (For he was from all Eternity com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleatly
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:208153:33"/>happy, and infinitely perfect in himself) but merely out of his own <hi>free good Pleasure,</hi> for the manifestation of his Power and Wisdom, and that his <hi>Goodness</hi> might be communicated to the Creatures, <hi>Psal.</hi> 19.1. <hi>Prov.</hi> 16.4. <hi>Of Him, and through Him, and from Him are all things,</hi> Rom. 11.36.</p>
               <p n="4">IV. That the world is not <hi>Eternal,</hi> appears from <hi>Natural Reason;</hi> for as from the Scriptures, the years from the Creation may with a suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient certainty be numbred; but there is no probable Presence or Account of any great Actions or Revolutions before that time, (for the <hi>Dynasties</hi> of the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> and boasts of the <hi>Chineses,</hi> and Dreams of the <hi>Pre-Adamites</hi> are wholly vain and fabulous;) so if the World had <hi>no Beginning,</hi> then it must be <hi>God;</hi> and there would be actually several <hi>Infinites,</hi> and all <hi>its Parts</hi> would be <hi>Eternal</hi> and <hi>Immutable,</hi> (whereas we find the direct contrary); the Generations of Men too would be infinite, and consequently the <hi>Grandson</hi> as old as the <hi>Grandfather,</hi> with many other Absurdities.</p>
               <p>But though by the Testimony of Nature we may know that the World was <hi>not always,</hi> yet 'tis chiefly by <hi>Faith</hi> (grounded on Divine Revelation) that we know it to have been <hi>Created out of No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,</hi> according to that forecited Text, <hi>Through Faith we understand that the World was framed by the Word of God, so that things which are seen, were not made of things which do appear,</hi> Hebr. 11.3.</p>
               <pb n="55" facs="tcp:208153:33"/>
               <p>The Epicurean conceit, that so Beautiful and Regular a structure should be produced by a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuitous Concourse of <hi>Atoms,</hi> is so gross, that as it was long since exploded by the most considerate Philosophers of the <hi>Heathen,</hi> so much less is it worthy the thoughts of a <hi>Christian.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">V. This Creation was either of the Species (or kinds) with <hi>all</hi> the Individuals (or particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars) as, all the <hi>Angels, Stars</hi> and <hi>Elements</hi> were at once Created together respectively; Or, of the Species with <hi>some Individuals</hi> only, endued with an innate power of propagating others, as Man, Beasts, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="6">VI. The Method Almighty God was pleased to use in Creating the World, and all things therein in six days, is expressed in the beginning of <hi>Genesis.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>How ought we to <hi>deliberate</hi> in all our Actions, who are so subject to Imperfection, since even <hi>He</hi> that is infinitely perfect, thought fit (not out of need, but of his own Free will) to take so many <hi>days</hi> in compleating his Works, which he could have finisht in an Instant!</p>
               <p>Again, we ought to observe, that many of the Creatures were made before those others, which now are ordinarily their <hi>Causes;</hi> whereby we may learn, that the Lord is not bound to any Creature, or means. Thus the Sun was not Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated before the 4th day, and yet <hi>days</hi> (which now are caused by the Rising of the Sun) were
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:208153:34"/>before that: So <hi>Trees</hi> and <hi>Plants</hi> were Created the third day, but the <hi>Sun, Moon, and Stars</hi> (by whose Heat and Influences they are now nourished, and made to grow) were not Created till after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards.</p>
               <p n="7">VII. But of all Creatures, <hi>ANGELS</hi> and <hi>MEN</hi> are chiefly to be considered; because on them God bestowed his Image; for although the <hi>Æ²niverse</hi> is (as it were) a <hi>Looking-Glass,</hi> or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presentation of Gods power, Wisdom and Boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; yet in a special manner his <hi>Image</hi> is Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted to them; Because that Image or Similitude doth consist partly in <hi>natural Gifts,</hi> as the invisible and simple substance of Angels and Mens Soul; and in their Life, Understanding, Will and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality, but especially in <hi>Supernatural Endow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi> as their primitive blessedness in the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rightness of their Intellect and Will, or (as the Apostle expresses it, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 4.24.) in <hi>Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and true Holiness.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="8">VIII. ANGELS are intelligent Creatures, void of Earthly Bodies, or Celestiall Spirits: whose Ministry God often uses for the Execution of his good pleasure.</p>
               <p>That there are such Glorious Incorporeal sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances may be gathered,</p>
               <p n="1">1. From <hi>Reason;</hi> because otherwise the Scale or Gradation of Creatures would be imperfect; for as there are many Bodies in the World <hi>with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any kind of Life,</hi> as Stones, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Others on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly endued with a <hi>Vegetative Life,</hi> as Plants; others
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:208153:34"/>both Vegetative and Sensitive, but <hi>wholly Mortal,</hi> as Beasts; others that have Bodies, and are both Vegetative, Sensitive and Intellectual, in <hi>part Mortal,</hi> and in <hi>part Immortal,</hi> as Men: It seems requisite to the compleating of the Universe, that there should be also some Creatures of an higher Class, without any such gross Bodies, that are <hi>wholy Spirituous,</hi> Intellectual, Immortal Beings; which yet are said to be of a simple or uncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded substance, only comparatively to other Creatures, since God alone is such <hi>Essentially,</hi> and they were in their own Nature subject to <hi>Mutation,</hi> as the Fall of many of them Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates.</p>
               <p n="2">2. From Scripture, Math. 22.30. <hi>In the Resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection they neither Marry, nor are given in Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/> but are as the Angels of God in Heaven,</hi> Ch. 24.31. <hi>He shall send his Angels with a great sound of a Trumpet,</hi> Hebr. 1.4. <hi>Christ is made so much better than the Angels.</hi> And Heb. 2.16. <hi>He in no sort took on him the Nature of Angels; with many other like places.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="9">IX. That Angels were Created, is no less evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, Gen. 2.1. <hi>Thus the Heavens and the Earth were finisht, and all the Host of them,</hi> Exod. 2.11. <hi>In six days the Lord made the Heaven and the Earth, the Sea, and all that in them is,</hi> Psal. 104.4. <hi>Who maketh his Angels Spirits; his Ministers a fla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming Fire,</hi> Coloss. 1.16. <hi>For by him were all things Created that are in Heaven, and that are in Earth, Visible and Invisible: Whether they be Thrones or
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:208153:35"/>Dominions, or Principalities or Powers, all things were Created by him, and for him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Reason why <hi>Moses</hi> does not expresly men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion the Creating of Angels, may be (as is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived) because he only sets forth the particular Formation of things Visible; and therefore not only omits them, but Minerals and other things hidden in the Bowels of the Earth; neither are we certain on what day they were Created. Some think on the first day, for which they alledge <hi>Job</hi> 38.7. St. <hi>Augustine</hi> was of the same Opinion as to the day, but thought they were included in those words, <hi>Let there be Light:</hi> Others Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute their Creation to the sixth day after Man; Their Reason is, because the Order of Creation seems all along to have proceeded from Visibles to Invisibles, from the less to the more Noble, as Mans Soul was Created after his Body.âBut the truth is, since God in his Word has not been pleased to Reveal it, to inquire thereof seems vain Curiosity; to affirm, Presumption.</p>
               <p n="10">X. The Offices of Angels declared in Scripture are Two-fold, in respect of God, and in respect of Men.</p>
               <p n="1">1. In respect of Godâand that either,</p>
               <p n="1">1. In praising and magnifying him, as Psalm. 148.2. <hi>Praise ye him all his Angels, praise ye him all his Host, Is</hi> 63.1. <hi>The</hi> Seraphim <hi>cryed one to another, Holy, Holy, Holy, Lord of Hosts, the whole World is full of thy Glory.</hi> So Rev. 4 8. <hi>They ceased not day nor night, saying, Holy, Holy, Holy, Lord God Almighty, which
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:208153:35"/>was, and which is, and which art to come.</hi> Hence that saying of <hi>Theodoret,</hi>

                     <desc>ã in non-Latin alphabet ã</desc>
                  </gap> The Liturgy (or <hi>Divine Service</hi>) of Angels is a constant Psalmody, or <hi>Singing of Hymns</hi> to God's Glory.</p>
               <p n="2">2. In Executing his Commands; whence they have their Name [the word <hi>Angelus</hi> in Greek signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying a Messenger]â<hi>praise the Lord ye his Angels that excel in strength, that do his Commandment in obeying his Word,</hi> Ps. 103.20. And from their rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diness and swiftness therein, they are in Scripture visions represented with Wings, <hi>Ezech.</hi> 1.6.</p>
               <p>In respect of Men,âtheir Office is manifold â <hi>Are they not all Ministring Spirits, sent forth to Minister for their sakes, who shall be Heirs of Salvation? Heb.</hi> 1.14. Thus they are Assistant to good Men, not only in their Life by guarding and delivering them, <hi>Ps.</hi> 91.11. 2 <hi>King.</hi> 6.17. <hi>Acts</hi> 12.8. By executing Gods Judgments on the Enemies of the Church, <hi>Gen.</hi> 19.10. 2 <hi>King.</hi> 19.35. By sug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gesting pious thoughts, and stirring them up to goodness, <hi>Acts</hi> 10.14. and by helping and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forting them in their Afflictions and Distresses, <hi>Gen.</hi> 16.7. <hi>Acts</hi> 27.23. But also in their Death, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ready to stand by them in their last Agonies, and Convey their departing Souls to Bliss, <hi>Luke</hi> 16.22. And lastly, in the end of the World they shall gather together the scattered dust of the Saints, that being reunited to their Souls, they may rise again to Life, <hi>Matth.</hi> 24.31. And will separate the wicked from the righteous, casting the former into the Furnace of Fire, and intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:208153:36"/>the latter into the Kingdom of Glory, <hi>Matth.</hi> 13.41. That there together with them, they may to all Eternity joyntly sing Hallelujahs to <hi>Jehovah</hi> their Maker.</p>
               <p n="11">XI. Yet as God needeth not the Ministry of Angels, but for the greater Manifestation of his power, and the more to engage our Love and Gratitude, is graciously pleased to employ those glorious Creatures in our Service: <hi>So neither are we obliged, nor is it lawful for us to ascribe any part of his glory unto them by any Religious Adoration (praying to) or Worshipping them.</hi>

                  <head>The Reasons.</head>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Our Lord Christ saith, thou shalt Worship the Lord thy God, and in him</hi> only <hi>shalt thou serve, Matth.</hi> 4.10. Where note, that the word <hi>only</hi> is not in the Old Testament Texts, <hi>Deut.</hi> 6.13. or <hi>Ch.</hi> 10.20. Whence those words are cited, but our Saviour puts it in, to shew the meaning to be, that God, <hi>and none but Hee,</hi> is the Object of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Worship and Service.âwhich word [Service] quite destroys that fained distinction of <hi>Latria</hi> and <hi>Doulia</hi> [Worship and Religious Service] of which some say, the former belongs indeed only to God, but the latter may be appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the Creature: Whereas both here, and in several other places of Holy Writ, they are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciprocally used, and appropriated wholly to God. âNo less vain is that other Distinction of <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior</hi> and absolute Worship, as due to God, and
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:208153:36"/>
                     <hi>Inferior</hi> or Relative Worship, as applicable to Creatures: For if by Inferior and Relative, be meant Religious Worship, (and so it must be meant, or else it comes not up to the matter in question) there is no Foundation for any such di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction in the whole Book of God; But on the contrary, we are there assured, that our God is a <hi>jealous Lord,</hi> and will not suffer his Glory to be given to another.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. We are expresly fore-warn'd against this Invocation or Worship of <hi>Angels</hi> by St. <hi>Paul,</hi> Coloss. 2.18. <hi>Let no Man beguil you of your re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward in a voluntary Humility and Worship of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, intruding into those things which he hath not seen, vainly puft up in his fleshly mind; and not holding the Head, from which all the Body by Joynts and Bands having Nourishment ministred, and knit together, increaseth with the encrease of God â where the Apostle sets forth,</hi> 1. The pretence of such VVor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, <hi>viz.</hi> a voluntary (or foolish affectation of) Humility; For these Angel-VVorshippers blam'd those of Presumption, that would Address their Petitions streight to God, and use no under-means, besides Christ. 2ly. That they devised their VVill-VVorship of themselves, and had no good grounds for it; but that notwithstanding their shew of Humility, it did indeed proceed from Pride, their fleshly minds willing to bring in something in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, more than God had Commanded. And 3ly. That the same was injurious to Christ, rob'd him of his Honour, and was in effect a denial of him, who is our only Intercessor and Advocate;
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:208153:37"/>and alone sufficient both to nourish and Encrease his whole Body the Church.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. As Men ought not to give this VVorship, so good Angels are more sensible of their Maker's Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, and their own Condition, than to receive it; For twice, when St. <hi>John</hi> was about to fall down before the Angel (who had revealed to him great Mysteries) to VVorship him, he was earnestly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provedâ<hi>see thou do it not.</hi>âAnd the reason given; <hi>for I am thy fellow Servant, Rev.</hi> 19.10. and <hi>Ch.</hi> 22.9.

It cannot be imagined, that the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved Disciple intended to VVorship this Angel as God; Therefore 'tis plain, the Angel did refuse and disclaim any kind of Religious Adoration whatsoever to himself, and directs where the same must be intirely paidâ<hi>Worship thou God,</hi> as much as to say, he is the only Object of all Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious VVorship.</p>

                     <p>VVhat Angel should this be, that could of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self Redeem <hi>Jacob</hi> from all Evil? The same that
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:208153:37"/>is here said to be an Angel, is in the words immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately foregoing twice called God.â<hi>The God be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore whom my Fathers did walk; the God which hath fed me all my Life long unto this day; the</hi> Angel <hi>which hath redeemed me from all Evil, Bless,</hi> &amp;c. Hence 'tis plain, that by Angel in this Text, is meant the Second Person of the Adorable Trinity, the Eternal Son of God, who <hi>Mal.</hi> 3.1. is called <hi>the Angel of the Covenant;</hi> and <hi>Isai.</hi> 63.9. The <hi>Angel of Gods Presence,</hi> and <hi>Rev.</hi> 8.3. The <hi>Angel with the Golden Censer Offering up the Prayers of the Saints.</hi> And indeed he it was that often ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to the Patriarchs in the Shape of Man, as a Prodromus or Fore-running of his Incarnation; For <hi>Gen.</hi> 18.13. after the mention of an Angel's appearing, 'tis said of the same, The Lord said to <hi>Abraham,</hi> why doth <hi>Sarah</hi> laugh? And <hi>Gen.</hi> 32.28. Thou hast prevailed with an Angel; which is thus explained, <hi>Hosea</hi> 12.4. He prevailed with God. Tho still we deny not but Created Angels have sometimes appeared to Men, and even in visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble assumed Shapes; but this we affirm, that they were never lawfully VVorshiped; we never read of any Created Angel that was pleased with, or desired to be VVorshiped, but the Devil. For</p>
                     <p n="12">XII. Tho all Angels, as the rest of the Creation, were at first Created <hi>Good</hi> (and of such we have hitherto treated) yet some of them quickly for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sook their Integrity: For being made, tho good, yet <hi>Mutable;</hi> they fell from that Blessed State; and as by the depravity of their own VVills, without
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:208153:38"/>any Temptation, they are become Evil and Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievous in the highest degree: So God in his just Judgment Banisht them Heaven: and they remain doom'd to a present and irrecoverable Misery, tho the full Accomplishment of their Punishment be reserved until the end of the World, <hi>Jude</hi> 6. 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.4. 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.3. <hi>Matth.</hi> 25.41. These the Scripture calls <hi>Evil Angels,</hi> and <hi>Angels of Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,</hi> Malignant and <hi>Æ²nclean Spirits,</hi> and in the Singular Number (as carrying on all one and the same Mischievous Design) <hi>The Devil</hi> (which sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies a <hi>Slaunderer,</hi> because their Business is to Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>represent God to Men, and good Men to God, and one Man to another) and <hi>Satan</hi> (that is, <hi>an Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versary,</hi> since they are Capital Enemies both to God and Man) and the <hi>Old Serpent,</hi> for their Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Temptations; And the great <hi>Dragon,</hi> for their destroying of Souls.</p>
                     <p n="13">XIII. As to the exact <hi>Time,</hi> or certain <hi>Number,</hi> or by what <hi>Special Sin</hi> these Angels fell, the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is not express; And therefore we are not to be too Inquisitive: Only tis certain they fell be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Man, since through their Temptation he Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grest; And that there are many of them, <hi>Luke</hi> 8.30. And that their Sin whatever it was, whether <hi>Pride, Envy,</hi> or Hatred of Truth (or rather a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of all these and more, since it was an utter falling away from God, and that Holy State he had placed them in) was not without the Highest <hi>Presumption,</hi> since Pride is joyned to every Sin that is committed Maliciously, and with De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberation.</p>

                        <pb n="65" facs="tcp:208153:38"/>XIV. If it be inquired, Why the Fall of these Angels is without hope of Restitution, whereas Man was put into a possibility of Recovery after his Fall?âIt may be answer'd, (I conceive) That the Case was different in many respects: For,</p>
                     <p n="1">1. The Angels sin'd without any Temptation, and that too maliciously, thereby committing the sin against the Holy Ghost, (<hi>Matth.</hi> 12.31: 1 <hi>John</hi> 5.16.) which is proved by their conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual obstinate Rebellion and Hatred against God.</p>
                     <p n="2">2dly, (Which indeed ought to have been men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned in the first place) because their Restitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, if they should fall, was not comprehended in the Eternal Decree of God for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose.</p>
                     <p>And 3dly, Because they had therefore none ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to make their <hi>Atonement,</hi> or be a <hi>Mediator</hi> and <hi>Intercessor</hi> for them, of which the Apostle takes Notice, <hi>Hebr.</hi> 2.16. <hi>Christ in no sort took on him the Nature of Angels.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>So if it be askt, Why the good Angels that continued in their glorious state after the others, have not nor can at any time fall? Our Answer must be, That it is not from their own Nature, (which was subject to Mutability as well as the rest) but from God's Mercy and Grace, confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them in their well-being, that they might never fall by sin from their first blessed Estate, whence they are call'd <hi>the Elect Angels,</hi> 1 Tim. 5.21.</p>

But such their knowledge being devoid of Charity, without any love to God or Man, but an obstinate restless ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice against both, and a total despair of happiness, can afford them no comfort, but rather strikes them with perpetual horrorâ<hi>What have we to do with thee, Jesus thou Son of God? Art thou come to torment us before our time?</hi> Mat. 8.29. <hi>Thou believest there is one God, thou doest well: the Devils also believe, and tremble,</hi> Jam. 2.19.</p>

                     <p n="1">1. To tremble at the Lord's severity towards them, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.4. and to be thankful for his Bounty and Mercies towards our selves.</p>
                     <p n="2">2dly, To consider, That if God spared not those spiritual Creatures sinning against him, much less will he spare us rebelling against his Majesty, if we get not an Interest in the <hi>Blessed Jesus,</hi> who alone can make a Reconciliation for us.</p>

                     <p>And lastly, To be comforted with this assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, That though the Devil be powerful, and most malicious and vigilant against us, yet our Lord and Captain Christ hath broken his Head,

                     <p n="19">XIX. The next Creature in dignity to <hi>AN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>GELS,</hi> is <hi>MAN;</hi> and so far above all others, That whereas Earth and Water at God's Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand brought forth the rest, for his Formation there was, as it were, a Council of the Blessed Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity held, and greater deliberation usedâ<hi>Let us make Man in our own Image,</hi> Gen. 1.26.</p>
                     <p n="20">XX. Man is a Creature consisting of a Body, (which originally was formed of Earth, but since propagated by Generation or Traduction) and a reasonable immortal Soul created of nothing, and immediately infused by Godâ<hi>The Body of the first Woman was formed of a Rib taken out of the side of the Man,</hi> Gen. 2.22. but her Soul im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately created and infused like his, and they both are comprehended under the Name of <hi>Man. Thus God created Man in his own Image, in the Image of God he created him: male and female created he them,</hi> Gen. 1.27.</p>
                     <p>He was made the last of the Creatures, as being the most excellent of all the works of God in this inferior world, and that he might glorifie his Maker for all the Creatures wherewith he saw the world furnisht for his sake: As also because the Lord would have him first provided for, before he brought him into the world, that so he might have
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:208153:40"/>this world of which God had made him Prince, as it were his Palace richly accommodated with all Things convenient for him.âAnd if our most gracious God had such care of Man even be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he was, how much more now he is?</p>
                     <p n="21">XXI. The Soul of Man (though it be hard to be defin'd, for as the Eye that sees other Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects sees not it self; so the Soul, by which we un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand other things can difficultly comprehend its own Essence, yet) we may not unfitly describe it to beâ<hi>A spiritual substance created by God, which being united to the human Body, makes them both one subsistence or person, and serves not only to animate (or enliven) the Body, and render its Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans apt for certain Functions and Actions, but also is the proper subject of all Vertues and Vices, Sciences and Arts, and has the rule of the Body, and ought to govern Man's whole life, and to excite him to the knowledge and worship of God his Creator, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is endowed with five principal Faculties,</hi> Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing, Will, Affections, Memory, <hi>and</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science: <hi>Which spiritual substance, though most near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly united to the Body, is yet separable from it, which separation is called Death, because then immediately the Body perishes, but the Soul dies not, but remains immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal, and at the last day shall again be reunited to its peculiar Body.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Hence the Soul is called <hi>the Breath of God,</hi> Gen. 2.7. and <hi>Mal.</hi> 2.15. because God made it not of any earthly matter (as he did the Body) nor of any of the Elements (as he did the other Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures)
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:208153:41"/>but immediately out of nothing, whereby is signifi'd the difference between the Soul of Man, which was made a spiritual, divine, everlasting sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, and the Soul or life of Beasts which cometh of the same matter whereof their Bodies are made, and therefore dieth with them. Whereas the Soul of Man cometh by God's Creation from without (in which respect God is said to be <hi>the Father of our spirits,</hi> Hebr. 12.9.) and doth not rise as the Souls of Beasts do, of the Temper of the Elements, but is created of God, free from composition, that it might be immortal, and free from the corruption, decay and death that all other Creatures are subject unto; and therefore as it had life in it self when it was join'd to the Body, so it retaineth life when it is separated from the Body, and liveth for ever.</p>
                     <p n="22">XXII. That the Soul is altogether immortal, and neither <hi>totally perishes</hi> nor <hi>sleeps</hi> (as some suppose) <hi>until the Resurrection,</hi> is gather'd from sundry Texts of Scripture: As,</p>
                     <p n="1">1. It is said, <hi>That at Death the dust shall return to the earth as it was, and the spirit to God who gave itâª</hi> Eccles. 12.7.</p>
                     <p n="2">2dly, Our Saviour Christ, <hi>Luke</hi> 23.46. and his first Martyr <hi>Stephen,</hi> Acts 7.59. at their death <hi>commended their souls unto God.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="3">3dly, The Thief's Soul, immediately after sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration from the Body, is promised to be in <hi>Paradise Luke</hi> 23.43.</p>
                     <p n="4">4thly, The Soul cannot be killed by them that
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:208153:41"/>kill the Body: <hi>Fear ye not them that kill the Body, but are not able to kill the Soul; but rather fear him who is able to destroy both Soul and Body in hell,</hi> Mat. 10.28. <hi>God shall deliver my Soul from the power of the Grave, for he will receive me,</hi> Psal. 49.15. <hi>I saw under the altar the souls of them that had been killed for the Word of God,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Rev.</hi> 6.9.</p>
                     <p n="5">5thly, The horrors of Conscience, and natural Fears of punishment for Sin proves the same.</p>
                     <p>And lastly, If it were otherwise, the hopes and comforts of good men would be utterly dasht, or very much abated: <hi>For if in this life only we have hope, we are of all men most miserable,</hi> 1 Cor. 15.19.</p>
                     <p n="23">XXIII. That the Soul of Man is not propaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by <hi>Traduction,</hi> (or begotten by the Parents) but immediately created by God and infused into the Body, is generally granted for these Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons:</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Because 'tis evident from <hi>Gen.</hi> 2.5. &amp; 7. That God created the first Man's Soul of Nothing; but it cannot be proved, That God endu'd any Thing which he created <hi>immediately</hi> out of No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing with power to propagate it self; but rather the contrary appears, if we make a particular In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction from all the Creatures. Nothing is gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated of <hi>matter,</hi> but what in the beginning was created of <hi>matter;</hi> but the Soul of Man in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning was not created of <hi>matter,</hi> therefore it cannot generate other Souls.</p>
                     <p n="2">
                        <pb n="72" facs="tcp:208153:42"/>2. God in a peculiar manner is called, <hi>The God of the Spirits of all flesh,</hi> Numb. 16.22. And said to have <hi>made the Breath</hi> (that is, the Soul) <hi>of man, Isa.</hi> 57.16. And more expresly, <hi>Job.</hi> 33.4. <hi>The Spirit of God hath made me, and the Breath of the Almighty hath given me life.</hi> And <hi>Zech.</hi> 12.1. <hi>The Lord stretcheth out the Heavens, and layeth the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of the Earth, and formeth the Spirit of Man within him</hi>âWhere this forming of the Spirit of Man seems plainly reckoned amongst the works of Creation, though daily performed, and therefore <hi>Hebr.</hi> 12.9. God, under the Title of <hi>the Father of Spirits,</hi> or <hi>Souls,</hi> is put in contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction to the Fathers of our BodiesâMore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, we have had the Fathers of our Bodies who corrected us, and we gave them Reverence, should we not much rather be in subjection unto the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of our Spirits that we might live?</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Christ had truly an Human Soul, but the same was not by Traduction; for he was concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved not by the help of Man, but by the operation of the Holy Ghost, of the Blessed Virgins Blood, therefore our Souls are not by Traduction.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. Such is Man's Generation as his Dissolution; but Man's Dissolution is, <hi>That his Body returns to Dust, and his Spirit to God that gave it,</hi> Eccl. 12.9. Wherefore since in his Dissolution his Spirit re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns immediately to God, doubtless it was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately formed by him.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. Because the Soul is Indivisible, therefore can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be generated or die, but must be immediately created of nothing.</p>
                     <p n="6">
                        <pb n="73" facs="tcp:208153:42"/>6. The Soul cannot be produced out of any pre-existent matter, either Corporeal, because it is not a Body; nor Incorporeal, because Spirits and Incorporeal Substances admit no Change or Transmutation.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. If the Soul be by Traduction, it must be ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerated of a Soul, or of a Body, or of both toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; but it is not generated of a Soul, because of that which is incorruptible nothing can be ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerated; nor of a Body, because it is not Corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>real; nor of a Soul and a Body together, because so it should be partly Corporeal, and partly Incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poreal; seeing then it is produced of nothing, it must be immediately from God alone, whose sole Prerogative it is to make things of nothing.</p>

                     <p>It may, notwithstanding God's Creation and Infusion of the Soul, be truly said, That Man be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gets; that is, is the efficient Cause of Man, thÃ´ not according to all his parts, both because a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son begets a person, as also for that by the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents the Body begot is as it were the Subject of the Soul, to which being united, the whole Man is brought into this World by means of Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: For as he is said to kill a Man that kills only his Body, so Man is said to beget Man, thÃ´
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:208153:43"/>he begets not the Soul. Nor yet is Man in this respect Ignobler than other living Creatures, but rather for this very Cause more excellent, in that, God's immediate Operation concurs with Nature's work in his Generation.</p>

                     <hi>If God in every one creates the Soul, then, as often as any one is born of Fornication, Adultery or Incest, God seems to co-operate therewith, and so must be the Author, or Approver of Sin, which is Blasphemy.</hi>

                     <p>We must distinguish between an Action, as meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly an Action, and the sin or unlawfulness of that Action. God does not co-operate with the Sin, but only brings Good out of Evil: For as the Earth cherishes Seed sown, thÃ´ stolen by the Sower, yet is not therefore any way concern'd in the Theft; so God animates the <hi>Embrio</hi> in the Womb, whether lawfully or unlawfully begot, thÃ´ he approve not the wicked Copulation, but will severely punish it. [This is St. <hi>Augustine</hi>'s Comparison and Answer to this Objection, in his 28 <hi>Epist. ad Hieron.</hi>]</p>
                     <p>Man being thus created, and placed in Paradise, [or <hi>a Garden of delight,</hi> as the word signifies] was vested with wonderful Happiness, both <hi>Internal</hi> and <hi>External.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Inwardly.</hi> First, By that Image of God, or Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine state of Soul, and Integrity of Nature where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he was created, that is, in Holiness and Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness, a clearness of Understanding, Liberty and Rectitude of Will, Moderation and Sanctity
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:208153:43"/>of Affections, all which shined in him without blemish. 2dly, In the Fruition of the favourable blissful presence of his Creator, and a joyful serving of him with full content in himself.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Outwardly.</hi> First, In enjoying so comely, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, and admirable a Body, in which there was no infirmity, pain or shame, thÃ´ naked, <hi>Gen.</hi> 2.25. And which too, thÃ´ not simply, yet in some sense might be said to be Immortal. For thÃ´, as it was composed of the Elements, 'twas subject to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved into its Principles, yet, by Divine Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, it had a possibility not to die.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, In his Dominion over all the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, who freely submitted to him, and to whom, as their Lord, he gave their original Names, and that too (which shews his great understanding in natural things) according to the nature of each, <hi>Gen.</hi> 2.19.</p>
                     <p n="25">XXV. All these Priviledges were not bestow'd on Man, That he should live as he list, but that he might serve the Lord his Maker, who therefore gave him a Law (written in his heart, being the substance of what we call the Moral Law) obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging him for ever to all Holiness and Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness. And for a further manifestation of his own Sovereignty and Trial of Man's Obedience, gave him likewise a special Command, viz. <hi>That he should not eat of the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil,</hi> Gen. 2.17. (Which was so called from the Event; for by tasting thereof, Man, by woful Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, came to know how great the Happiness and Good was which he had lost, and how great
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:208153:44"/>Evil and Misery he had brought upon him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self.)</p>
                     <p>As God was Man's Creator, and in that respect his absolute Sovereign, Man must needs owe him an intire Obedience, especially since he required no more than what he had enabled him to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form; and therefore to make trial of his Loyalty and Humility, God might most justly enjoin him to abstain from some Act in itself indifferent, for no other Reason apparent, but because he was so com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded. This general Law and special Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was reinforc'd with all the usual attendants of all just Laws, <hi>viz.</hi> a Sovereign Right in the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistator, a sufficient Promulgation, a full Ability in the Subject to perform them, Reward promised to Obedience, and Punishment threatned in case of Failure, If he transgressed, <hi>he should surely dye, Gen.</hi> 2.17. But if he obey'd, he and his Posterity should continue in that good estate; of which the Tree of Life seems to have been intended either for a means by its innate quality to preserve Man's Life, as some gather from <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.22. or at least a Sign or Seal (whence many Divines call both it and the Tree of Knowledge <hi>Sacramental</hi>) of the good pleasure of God to continue Man persisting in Obedience, in full vigor here, till he should think fit to translate him (like <hi>Enoch</hi>) to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</p>
                     <p>So much touching the Creation of the world.</p>
                     <p n="26">XXVI. The other work of God to be consider'd, is the sustaining and Government thereof, which is
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:208153:44"/>called his <hi>actual Providence;</hi> For God is not like an Architect, that is the cause only of the making, but cannot maintain his Building against all Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents: But he is such a cause of Being to all Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, as the <hi>Sun is of Light</hi> to the Day, so that without his continual operation, all would return to Nothing or Confusion, <hi>Psal.</hi> 104.29.</p>
                     <p>God's Providence therefore is, <hi>That by which he both sustains, preserves, and also freely, according to his infinite Wisdom, Goodness, Power, Justice and Mercy, rules and governs all his Creatures.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>That such an actual Providence does preside over the world, appears</p>
                     <p>First, By <hi>Reason,</hi> from that agreement of Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and Things which are most contrary, and would consume each other, if not thereby hindred, from the means of our daily preservation and nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishment; For Meat, Drink and Cloathing, being void of heat and life, could not preserve the life of man, and continue heat in him, unless there were a special Providence of God to give vertue to them, without which, Wheat would no more nourish us than Sand. From the Order, Harmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, and Connexion we see every where in the world; the Rewards promised, Punishments threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and both accomplished; the various distri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bution of the endowments of Body and Mind; the preservation and translation of Empires, strange Discoveries of secret Crimes, signal Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments on the wicked, and wonderful protection or supports of good Men, and many other daily Occurrences ar illustrious Arguments hereof.</p>
                     <pb n="78" facs="tcp:208153:45"/>
                     <p>And indeed to deny this Providence, is to deny God himself; For he could not be God, if he did not order things to their respective Ends; and if he were not good and prudent, both which Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes are no less display'd in the ordering, than in the creating of the World.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, The same appears by various <hi>express Texts</hi> of Scripture, as <hi>Matth.</hi> 5.17. <hi>My Father worketh hitherto, and I also work,</hi> meaning in the continuance and conservation of the Creatures: <hi>For in him we live and move, and have our being,</hi> Acts 17.28. and <hi>Hebr.</hi> 1.3. 'tis said of our Lord Christ, <hi>That he upholds all things by the word of his power.</hi> The whole 104th <hi>Psalm</hi> is a particular De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration of this Divine Providence; and we are taught the same extends to the minutest Actions, and even those that seem the most casual: <hi>Are not two Sparrows sold for a farthing? Yet one of them shall not fall to the ground without your Father, for even the hairs of your head are numbred,</hi> Mat. 10.29. <hi>The Lot is cast into the lap: but the whole disposing thereof is from the Lord,</hi> Prov. 16.33.</p>
                     <p>Thus there really is no such thing in the world as <hi>Chance</hi> or <hi>Fortune,</hi> in respect of God, but in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of Man that knoweth not future things, or is ignorant of the Causes of somewhat present, many things appear to be Casual, and so in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance with their Notions, the Scripture useth those terms, to express the suddenness and unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectedness of a thing, as when it saith, <hi>Time and Chance happen to all,</hi> Eccl. 9.11. <hi>And, By chance there came down a certain Priest that way,</hi> Luke 10.21.</p>
                     <p n="27">
                        <pb n="79" facs="tcp:208153:45"/>XXVII. By God's Providence both <hi>Good</hi> and <hi>Evil</hi> are governed, <hi>viz. good</hi> things by an effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious action, or effectual working, <hi>evil</hi> by an actual permission; as likewise by restraining the same within certain bounds, and directing it to some good Issue.</p>
                     <p>Yet still God's Providence remains pure, just and undefiled, even in those Actions that are dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order'd and sinful: For,</p>
                     <p>First, 'Tis one thing to be the <hi>Cause</hi> of an Action, merely as 'tis an Action, and another thing to be the Cause of the Evil, or adhering vitiosity of that Action; as he that rides a lame Horse causeth him to stir, but is not the cause of his halting.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, He who quenches a Fire that it rage no further, is far from being the cause of the Fire.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, As it is a commendable skill to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare a Composition with a mixture of Poyson in it, which yet shall not be poysonous, but highly medicinal; so the power and wisdom of God is the more display'd in his guiding and managing the poyson of sin, so as to turn it in the end to his own glory, and the good of his Church.</p>
                     <p>Therefore althÃ´ the Scripture ascribes many times the same action, or work to God, to the Devil, and to wicked men, as <hi>Gen.</hi> 45.8. <hi>Job</hi> 1.21. 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 22.22. And particularly both <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das,</hi> the <hi>Jews,</hi> and <hi>Pilate,</hi> are said <hi>to have given Christ to death;</hi> and the same expression is used both of God the Father, and our Lord Christ him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:208153:46"/>
                        <hi>Acts</hi> 2.23. and 4.28. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.32. yet the causing of Sin cannot in any wise be imputed to God, since the manner and purposes are different and contrary:</p>
                     <p>For the Actions of the wicked are discernable from the work of God therein.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. In the <hi>ground</hi> from whence they arise; as <hi>Joseph</hi>'s Brethren of envy sent him into <hi>Egypt,</hi> but God in love and mercy; <hi>Shimei</hi> cursed <hi>David</hi> out of malice, God permitted it in justice to mortifie <hi>David</hi> for his Adultery and Murder. The Devil from hate to Mankind was a lying Spirit in the mouths of all <hi>Ahab</hi>'s Prophets, God permitted it as a punishment for his Idolatry; <hi>Pilate</hi> of Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition and Fear; the <hi>Jews</hi> of Malice, Envy, and Ignorance; and <hi>Judas</hi> out of Covetousness, but God of love gave Christ to death; and therefore the Action as it was from God, was most holy, righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous, and merciful.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, In the <hi>Scope</hi> or <hi>End</hi> to which they tend:</p>
                     <p>Thus <hi>Joseph</hi>'s Brethren sent him away, to the end he should not come to the Honour foretold by his Dream, but God sent him to provide for his Church, and fulfil what was so foretold.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Shimei</hi> cursed, to drive <hi>David</hi> to despair, but God directed it for exercising <hi>David</hi>'s pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience.</p>
                     <p>The Devil lyed in the false Prophets to seduce <hi>Ahab,</hi> God permitted it justly as a punishment for his Idolatry.</p>
                     <p>So in our Lord's Crucifixion, the end of <hi>Pilate</hi>
                        <pb n="81" facs="tcp:208153:46"/>was to humor the People, and keep himself in <hi>Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sar</hi>'s Favor.</p>
                     <p>Of <hi>Judas</hi> to get Money, and of the <hi>Jews</hi> to gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie their Malice, but God's design was to redeem Mankind.</p>
                     <p>XXVIII. God's Providence is either <hi>Ordinary,</hi> or <hi>Extraordinary.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The <hi>Ordinary</hi> or usual Providence is, when God proceeds in that Order as in the beginning he did endue things withal, as for the Sun to run his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>urnal and Annual Circuit; Fire to burn and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And thus every thing, according to its innate property, acts or suffers upon or by another, and Effects like so many Links of a Chain depend up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their Causes; which common vertue and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordination of things is that which we call NA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TURE.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Extraordinary</hi> is, when God by his Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Prerogative, contradicts or suspends those setled Laws of Nature, <hi>as to make the Sun stand still; the fiery Furnace not to burn the three Children cast into it,</hi> &amp;c. All which (by a <hi>Metonymie</hi> of the effect) are called MIRACLES.</p>
                     <p>XXIX. From this Doctrin of Providence we ought to learn,</p>
                     <p>First, To acknowledge and adore the Power, Wisdom, and Goodness of God, as in the Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, so in the Continuation, Preservation, and Government of all things; and to dread to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend his Majesty, who every moment can arm all the Creatures against us.</p>
                     <pb n="82" facs="tcp:208153:47"/>
                     <p>Secondly, To love and repose our Trust in him as our Father that continually is taking care for us, to acquiesce under his protection, since all the dangers we can apprehend, and the malice of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan and all his Instruments are subject to his over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruling restraint and good pleasure; and therefore to banish all slavish Fear from our hearts, as know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing nothing can come to pass without the Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of God.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, As this Consideration should in pros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perity, and when things succeed according to our desires, advance our Gratitude to God, to give him the praise and glory thereof, and not <hi>sacrifice to our own nets,</hi> (Hab. 1.16.) or regard only the next Instruments, without looking up to him by whose special Providence we enjoy those mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies; so in Adversity, and when things answer not our Expectation, it ought to teach us Patience and Humility under the hand of the Lord in all affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, saying, <hi>It is the Lord, let him do what he pleaseth,</hi> 1 Sam. 3.18.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, Not to neglect any means which God hath ordained, if we can procure them, (for that is to tempt God) nor yet to depend solely on them, without having an Eye to him who can pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently render them ineffectual; much less should we presume to venture on any means that are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful or sinful, since we are sure not to obtain any blessing in such Courses.</p>
                     <p>And lastly, If means be wanting, yet still we ought to confide in him who can work as well without means as with them.</p>

               <head>CHAP. IV. <hi>Of the Covenant of</hi> Works. <hi>The</hi> Fall <hi>of our first Parents, with the Miseries thence con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted on themselves and their Posterity. Of</hi> Sin, <hi>Original and Actual. Of the sin against the</hi> Holy Ghost.</head>
               <p n="1">I. MAn is to be consider'd here on earth as in a Threefold State, <hi>viz.</hi> of <hi>Innocence,</hi> of <hi>Misery,</hi> and of <hi>Grace;</hi> And afterwards in a Fourth, to wit, that of Everlasting Glory or Perdition.</p>
               <p>Of the State of <hi>Innocency</hi> we have partly spoken in the foregoing Chapter, shewing how perfectly he was made and richly endowed both in Soul and Body, and how God prescribed him a Law, and enabled him with Power to perform the same; and so left him in the hand of his own Counsel either to stand or fall; which Government of man is called the <hi>Covenant or Works,</hi> because grounded on condition of perfect Obedience by that strength wherewith God had endued him at his first Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation. â <hi>Do this</hi> [that is, keep all my Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments in thought word and deed] <hi>and thou shalt live;</hi> [that is, enjoy the reward of Blessed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and Everlasting life.] <hi>But if thou doest it not, thou shalt dye the death;</hi> [that is, incur the Curse of God, many Miseries both of Soul and Body with Temporal death in this World, and (where this
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:208153:48"/>Curse is not taken away) Everlasting death (that is, endless torment of both Soul and Body) in the World to come.]</p>
               <p n="2">II. Man tho he was made good, yet being Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table (for as God gave him a possibility of stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing if he would, so he left his Will free, that if he would he might fall,) did not continue in such his Integrity, but presently broke that Covenant of Works, willfully (through Satans Temptation) transgressing that Holy Law which was given him, and becoming Guilty of many sins at once by eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of that Fruit which alone in the whole Garden was forbidden him; thereby plunging himself and all his Posterity into a State of sin and wretched<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, which is called <hi>the fall of man. By the diso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience of one, sin raigned unto death, and death went over all,</hi> Rom. 5.12.</p>
               <p>God (to whom all things are present) knew well, that man would transgress; yet he was not therefore to forbear giving him a most just and easy Precept whereby to shew his own Soveraign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty over him; nor yet bound to uphold him to whom he had given sufficient Power to persist in Innocence if he would; And therefore when Mans Will at Satans suggestion began to encline to evil, God did suffer him to fall, as knowing how to manage the same for the Manifestation of his own. Mercy, Justice and Glory.</p>
               <p n="3">III. The manner of the Temptation is set forth in <hi>Cenesis</hi> the third, <hi>viz.</hi> That the Devil, being
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:208153:48"/>himself faln from his first happy and glorious State, out of an Envious and Murtherous mind, that he might bring Man into as wretched a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition as himself, making use of the Serpent (the subtlest beast in the Field that is, as the word used signifies in the Original, the most nimble and sly to turn and wind it self any way, and so the fittest to creep into the Garden unseen) did in it accost <hi>Eve</hi> (the weaker vessel) in the absence of her Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band with a crafty Question defign'd to make her doubt whether the Word of God were true or not; And finding her to answer not directly as God had spoken, but first by a kind of repining additi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that they were bound not to touch the Fruit of that Tree, whereas God only commanded not to eat thereof, And 2dly. By a term of doubting âlest ye dye; whereas God had said, ye shall surely dye; he proceeds to assure her, that they should not dye, but have their Eyes open'd, and receive Knowledge, and be as Gods, Insinuating that God out of Jealousy of his own Superiority or Envy to Man, had laid that Prohibition lest they should know as much as He; which blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Lye the Woman crediting did eat of the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Fruit, and gave thereof to her Husband, who by her allurement did the like.</p>
               <p n="4">IV. This Eating of the <hi>Forbidden Fruit</hi> was no little offence (as to some it may seem) but an horrible Transgression, no less than a breach of the <hi>whole Law of God;</hi> Or total Apostasie where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they withdrew themselves from his obedience,
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:208153:49"/>and with a most outragious Rebellion rejected and trampled on his Sovereignty: For,</p>
               <p n="1">1. As the heinousness of a Crime is not to be measured by the thing done, but by the dignity of the person against whom it is committed, which here was their Almighty and most Indulgent Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator, so by how much the Command was the more easie to be kept, (as to abstain from one only Fruit in so great a variety and plenty) by so much was their sin the more grievous in breaking it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. ThÃ´ God did specially try their Obedience in that Fruit, yet there were a multitude of other most vile sins which hereby they became guilty of, as Infidelity and Contempt of God, in hearkning to, and believing the Devil, rather than his Word; prodigious Ingratitude, Curiosity and Ambition, in affecting greater Knowledge than he thought fit to invest them with. Here was also Lying, in misreporting God's Command. Presumption, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temperance and Theft, in laying hand on that which was another's, without the Owner's con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent. Reproachful Blasphemy, by consenting to the Sayings of the Devil, in which he charged God with lying and envying their Happiness. Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, since by this Fact they precipitated them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves and all their Posterity into Condemnation and Death both of Body and Soul. Lust, by a wandring defire of the Eyes, and inordinate ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite of the Taste after that only Fruit which God had restrain'd them from. An assenting to a false Witness, and receiving an unjust Accusation against God himself. Lastly, Evil Concupiscence,
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:208153:49"/>or coveting that to which they had no Right, not being satisfied with all the other delicacies of the Garden.</p>
               <p n="5">V. The Effects or Consequents of this Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gression were,</p>
               <p n="1">1. A defacing of God's Image in all the Noble Faculties of their Souls, and a depravation of the powers of their Bodies.</p>
               <p n="2">2. A stream of actual sins in the whole course of their life following, which presently appear'd in <hi>Adam</hi>'s flying from God, and affirming falsly, <hi>That it was his Nakedness made him flie;</hi> and in, both his, and <hi>Eve</hi>'s excusing their sin, and laying of it, he, upon the <hi>Woman;</hi> and she, upon the <hi>Serpent.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, They became subject to a threefold death, <hi>viz. of the Soul</hi> by sin, whereby it being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived of the presence of the Holy Spirit, (which is the Soul's Soul) it became dead to God and Goodness, and alive only to Sin and Satan; to <hi>Natural Death,</hi> which is the separation of the Soul from the Body, and to a separation of both Soul and Body from God, which is <hi>Death Eternal.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fourthly, <hi>Adam</hi> in this matter is to be consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered not as a private, but publick person, (the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, Head and Root of all Mankind:) So that what he received and lost, concerned not only himself, but all his Posterity; and therefore by this primitive sin, all human kind was vitiated, so that as the Person then infected the Nature, so ever since the Nature (of all that come into the world by ordinary Generation) infects the Person, and that most justly too. For,</p>
               <pb n="88" facs="tcp:208153:50"/>
               <p>As <hi>Adam</hi>'s Felicity should have been ours if he had persevered therein, so was his voluntary self-contracted Transgression and Misery ours too, who are his Descendents. And as in the second Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant (whereof we shall speak by and by) the Righteousness of the second <hi>Adam,</hi> viz. <hi>Christ Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus the Mediator,</hi> is reckoned to all those that are begotten of him by spiritual Regeneration, to wit, those that sincerely believe in his Name. So in the first Covenant the sin of the first <hi>Adam</hi> (who herein sustained the part of a common person) is reckoned to all the Posterity that descend from him by carnal Generation, as being in his Loins when he fell, and so by the Law of Propagation sinned in him; as in Attainders for Treason the Criminal not only suffers, but his Blood is cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted, and all his Off-spring for ever lose the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit of his Honours and Estate, and become mixt in equal condition with the Rabble, unless the King in Favor restore them, as God in his mercy hath done us. Or rather, as a Man that becomes a Slave, his Progeny, to the hundredth Generation, shall continue in a state of Villainage and Slave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, unless they be manumitted. So the natural man, how free soever he may think himself, is no other than a Bondslave to Sin and Satan, and in that wretched state he and all his Issue shall for ever remain, <hi>unless the Son do make him free,</hi> John 8.33. <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.17. 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.19.</p>
               <p n="6">VI. This privation of original Righteousness, and native Corruption derived into the whole
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:208153:50"/>Man, and to all the Race of Mankind, naturally descending from <hi>Adam,</hi> is called ORIGINAL SIN: (The proximate cause of which, is the guilt of the aforesaid first Sin, in respect whereof 'tis a most just punishment from God, <hi>viz. a part of that death threatned to man.</hi>)</p>
               <p>And in Scripture, by way of Eminence, 'tis termed <hi>Sin,</hi> and <hi>the Body of Sin,</hi> or <hi>Old Man,</hi> Rom. 6.6. <hi>Concupiscence,</hi> Rom. 7.7. <hi>Sin in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habiting, ver.</hi> 17. and <hi>the Law of our Members,</hi> ver. 23.</p>
               <p n="7">VII. Original Sin standeth not in the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing [or imitating] of <hi>Adam,</hi> (as the <hi>Pelagians</hi> do vainly talk) but it is the Fault and Corruption of the Nature of every Man that naturally is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gendred of the Off-spring of <hi>Adam,</hi> whereby Man is very far gone from original Righteousness, and is of his own Nature inclined to Evil, so that the Flesh lusteth always contrary to the Spirit, and therefore in every person born into this world, it deserveth God's wrath and damnation; and this Infection of Nature doth remain, yea, in them that are regenerated, whereby the <hi>Lusts of the Flesh,</hi> called in <hi>Greek</hi>
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>ã in non-Latin alphabet ã</desc>
                  </gap>, which some do expound the <hi>Wisdom,</hi> some the <hi>Sensuality,</hi> some the <hi>Affection,</hi> some the <hi>Desire of the Flesh,</hi> is not subject to the Law of God. And also there is no <hi>Condemnation</hi> for them that <hi>believe</hi> and are <hi>baptized,</hi> yet the Apostle [<hi>Rom.</hi> 6.6. and 7.5.] doth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess, that <hi>Concupiscence</hi> and <hi>Lust</hi> hath, of itself, the Nature of Sin. [9th. <hi>Article of the Church of</hi> England.]</p>
               <p n="8">
                  <pb n="90" facs="tcp:208153:51"/>VIII. The condition of Man after the Fall of <hi>Adam</hi> is such, that he cannot turn and prepare himself by his own Natural strength and good Works to Faith and calling upon God; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we have no power to do good Works plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant and acceptable to God, without the Grace of God by Christ preventing us, that we may have a good Will, and working with us when we have that good Will. [<hi>Ibid. Art.</hi> 10.</p>
               <p>For Man by such his Fall hath wholly lost all Ability of Will to any Spiritual good accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying Salvation; So as a Natural Man being al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together averse from that good, and dead in Sin, is not able by his own strength to convert himself, or to prepare himself thereunto. But when God converts a sinner and translates him into the State of Grace, He freeth him from this his Natural Bondage under Sin, and by his Grace alone, ina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles him freely to Will and to do that which is Spiritually good; yet so, as that by reason of his remaining corruption he doth not perfectly nor only Will that which is good, but doth that also which is evil; for tis in the State of Glory that his Will is made perfectly and immediately free to Good alone.</p>

                     <p>To argue from the Command to the Power in this Case will not hold, because Man had Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally a Power, but by his own default lost and forfeited it; therefore there is no Tyranny in punishing him, nor are those precepts in vain, for though of our selves (now) we cannot perform them, yet we can do it when first excited there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to by the divine Grace, so that being acted, we act, God gives what he Commands and helps what he hath given; without Him we cannot make our selves good Men, and without our selves He is not wont to do it. Besides, these Commands re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated since the Fall are of great use, that Man finding the Impossibility he has plunged himself into, of answering them, may fly to Christ (in whom the faithful can do all things) and so they become efficacious means, which (together with his Grace) God uses, for converting of Souls, that what was impossible to corrupt Nature, may by Grace become feasible and easy.</p>

                     <p n="10">X. From this original depravation of our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture as from an invenom'd Fountain, and Satan's Temptations, there do daily flow the poysonous streams of <hi>ACTÆ²AL SIN,</hi> which is the viola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of God's holy Law, by evil thoughts, desires, words, or deeds.</p>
                     <pb n="95" facs="tcp:208153:53"/>
                     <p>There are four Degrees observable, by which men do ordinarily proceed in the committing of Actual Sin.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Temptation to sin, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 11.2. <hi>Jam.</hi> 1.14. which then only is sin in us, when either it ariseth from our own corrupt Imaginations, or from out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward occasions, to which we have carelesly, rashly, or presumptuously exposed our selves.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Concupiscence, which brings Sin to Concep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>Jam.</hi> 1.15. by entertaining the Sin where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto we are tempted, and suffering it to have abode in our mind or thoughts, thereby withdraw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the heart from God and his Commandments, and consulting, as it were, whether that Sin (which at the first Overture we ought to hate and abominate) may be done, or not, and so ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king a liking to it.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Consent, which brings Sin to the Birth.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. Repetition, by continuance in Sin, whereby the heart is hardned, (<hi>Hebr.</hi> 3.13.) and Sin comes to a perfection or ripeness, getting such strength, that it ruleth as a Master doth his Slave; and this is call'd <hi>the Reign or Dominion of Sin,</hi> in which estate whoever continueth, must look for eternal death.</p>
                     <p n="11">XI. No Sin of its own Nature is venial, or so small as not to merit damnation, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.10. and <hi>Jam.</hi> 2.10. because it is always an offence against an Infinite Majesty and Purity; yet in respect of the Event, <hi>viz.</hi> through Christ's Merits, and God's Favour in him, all Sins are venial or pardonable,
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:208153:54"/>except final Infidelity, and the Sin against the Holy Ghost.</p>
                     <p>Not as though even those were greater than Grace and Christ's Merit, but because they resist and despise both.</p>
                     <p>The Sin against the <hi>Holy Ghost,</hi> called also in Holy Scripture, <hi>the Sin unto Death,</hi> (by way of Eminence) is such as precipitates those that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit it, without any hopes of Remission, into eternal Damnation.</p>
                     <p>To determine the certain and particular <hi>spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies</hi> of this dreadful Sin, is somewhat difficult, and therefore our safest way will be to consult all the several Texts of Scripture where it is, or may seem to be mentioned, that we may discover both what it is, and what it is not.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. We read, 1 <hi>John</hi> 5.16. the Apostle in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structing us about praying one for another, saith, <hi>If any man see his Brother sin a sin which is not unto death, he shall ask, and he shall give him life for them that sin not unto death.</hi> There is a sin unto death, I do not say that he shall pray for it; <hi>All unrighteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness is sin, and there is a sin not unto death.</hi> Here this Sin unto death is distinguisht from unrighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness, which is, the <hi>Transgression</hi> of the whole Law; whence I gather, That this Sin against the Holy Ghost is not any Transgression of the Moral Law, either universal or particular; whether com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted either of Ignorance, or Infirmity, or Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. We may call to mind that place, <hi>Matth.</hi> 12.31. <hi>All manner of Sin and Blasphemy shall be
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:208153:54"/>forgiven unto Men, but the Blasphemy against the Holy Ghost shall not be forgiven. And whosoever speaketh a word against the Son of Man, it shall be forgiven him: But whosoever speaketh against the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghost, it shall not be forgiven him, neither in this world, nor in the world to come.</hi> And that of <hi>Paul,</hi> who, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.13. confesses that he had been a blasphemous Persecutor of Christ, but yet had ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained mercy, because he did it ignorantly through Unbelief. From whence I collect, That Blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my against, and Persecution of Christ and his Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, which proceeds of Ignorance, is not this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pardonable Sin.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Observe we the Sin of <hi>Peter,</hi> who, against his Conscience, denied his dear Lord Christ, and that too with Cursing, <hi>Mat.</hi> 26.74. but out of dread of the present danger, his Judgment not agreeing with his Tongue, and his Faith (for which our Lord had pray'd <hi>that it might not fail,</hi> Luk. 12.32.) not wholly extinct, but working still within; for else he had joyn'd with the Persecutors, whereas on the contrary he got him out of doors, and wept bitterly. Whence I also infer, That the denial of Christ that arises from Infirmity, and not out of Resolution intirely to reject him, which is not the Sin against the Holy Ghost, thÃ´ very near ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching thereunto.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. Having thus considered what this Sin is not, for our understanding affirmatively <hi>what it is,</hi> we must return to that before-cited Text, <hi>Mat.</hi> 12.31. where our Lord lays Blasphemy against the Holy Ghost to the charge of the <hi>Pharisees,</hi> who not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:208153:55"/>contemn'd him and his Gospel, but slander'd him by saying, <hi>That he cast out Devils by</hi> Beelzebub <hi>the Prince of Devils,</hi> and had an unclean Spirit, when yet out of the Prophets, and by his Doctrin and Miracles, they could not but know that he was the Christ, and that such his Works were perform'd by the power of the Holy Ghost. Whence I gather, that the matter or generical difference of the Sin against the Holy Ghost, is to deny Christ and his Gospel when known, and against a Man's own Knowledge and Conscience to ascribe that work to Satan, which is proper to the Holy Spirit.</p>
                     <p>This is one manner, or (as it were) Species of this horrid Sin, <hi>viz.</hi> of the <hi>Pharisees,</hi> and in like manner of all those, who tho' convinced of the Truth of the Gospel, do yet refuse to submit unto, and profess the same, but on the contrary do brand it with Reproaches and Calumnies, as Heretical, Erroneous, and Diabolical.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Lastly,</hi> That place, <hi>Hebr.</hi> 6.4. offers it self, <hi>it is impossible for those who were once enlightned, and have tasted of the Heavenly Gift, and were made partakers of the Holy Ghost; and have tasted the good Word of God, and the Powers of the World to come: If they shall fall away</hi> [that is, not into any particular Sin against the first or second Table, but into a total Apostacy from Christ] <hi>it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible to renew them again unto Repentance, seeing they Crucifie to themselves the Son of God afresh, and put him to open shame.</hi> With which agrees the 26, 27, 28, 29 <hi>verses</hi> of the 10th Chap. of the same
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:208153:55"/>
                        <hi>Epistle. If we sin wilfully</hi> [that is, by casting off the Profession of the Gospel, for of that he is there speaking, as appears <hi>vers.</hi> 23.] <hi>after that ye have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the knowledge of the Truth, there remaineth no more Sacrifice for Sins, but a certain fearful looking for of Judgment, and very Indignation, which shall devour the Adversaries. He that despised</hi> Moses<hi>'s Law, died without mercy, under two or three Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses. Of how much sorer punishment suppose ye, shall he be thought worthy, who hath troden under foot the Son of God, and hath counted the Blood of the Covenant wherewith he was Sanctified, an unholy thing, and done despite unto the Spirit of Grace?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Hence we discover the other manner or kind of this Sin, <hi>viz.</hi> That it is when Men after they have truly known Christ and his Gospel by the Holy Spirit enlightning their Hearts, and professed the same, shall totally and with full assent fall away, deny the Lord that bought them, and of prepens'd Malice Persecute his Truth with all their strength, and Revile him and it with Reproaches, contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning his inestimable Sacrifice.</p>
                     <p>Of the first sort, those beforementioned <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risees</hi> were an Instance: For they not only <hi>knew that Christ was of God,</hi> John 3.2. but also <hi>who he was. Ye both know me, and ye know whence I am,</hi> John 7.28.</p>
                     <pb n="100" facs="tcp:208153:56"/>
                     <p>And yet they ceased not, against the Dictates of their Consciences, to detract from his Divine Works, and out of hatred to the known Truth persecuted him even to death. Such too were some of the <hi>Jews,</hi> Acts 6.10. who, when they were not able to resist the evidence of the Spirit speaking by St. <hi>Stephen,</hi> yet endeavor'd to oppose it: For thÃ´ there were, no doubt, many amongst them, that were enraged by an ignorant zeal for their Law, (whence <hi>Peter</hi> recovered 3000 of them at once to Repentance, who had been guilty of crucifying our Saviour) but 'tis plain, there were others that resisted and acted out of malici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Impiety against the Doctrin, which they were not ignorant was of God.</p>
                     <p>Examples of the latter kind are <hi>Judas</hi> and <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian,</hi> sirnamed the <hi>Apostate;</hi> he, once an Apostle, yet maliciously betray'd his Master: This, at first rightly educated in the Christian Religion, in which he for some time eminently profess'd, but afterwards renounced the same, became an open Enemy to the Christian Name, and died with des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate Blasphemy in his mouth.</p>
                     <p>From what has been said, appears why this Sin is specially said to be committed against the Holy Ghost, <hi>viz</hi> not in respect of the Essence, or Divine person of the Spirit, (For the dignity of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit is not greater than that of the Father or Son, nor can one person of the Trinity be offended, but the Injury will redound to the whole Deity) but in respect of Grace and Illumination, which is the proper and immediate Office of the Holy Ghost,
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:208153:56"/>as Creation is more peculiarly attributed to the Father, and Redemption to the Son.</p>
                     <p>Thus much of the Sin against the <hi>Holy Ghost;</hi> whereon I have the larger insisted, because weak Christians are often apt to be perplexed in their Thoughts about it.</p>
                     <p n="13">XIII. The Degrees of other Sins are to be judged of by the Circumstances, which do either aggravate or extenuate them.</p>
                     <p>For Example: The Sin of a Superior is greater than of an Inferior, since Sin is so much the more conspicuous and spreading, by how much the more eminent he is that commits it. The Sin of Desire is greater than the Sin of Thought alone. A Sin committed in Word and Deed, greater than that in Thought or Desire. Done with Affectation or Presumption, greater than that of Ignorance or Incogitancy. Sins of Commission, greater than of Omission in the same kind. A Sin properly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst God, greater than against Man: And in respect of Men greater, when against One to whom we are most beholding, than against an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, as a Sin against our Parents is greater if it be in the same kind, than against a Brother; so a Scandal against a weak Brother is greater than against a stronger.</p>
                     <p n="14">XIV. The Consequents of Sin are, 1. Guilt, whereby we become justly liable to the Curse of God. 2. Punishment, which is the actual execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of God's wrath, whereby Man for his Sin is
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:208153:57"/>deliver'd up to several severe Judgments in this Life, and at last into the power of Corporal and Eternal Death begun here, and to be accomplish'd in the Life to come.</p>
                     <p n="15">XV. Eternal Death is the state of the Damned, consisting in the Everlasting Privation of the chief Good, that is, they are for ever excluded from God and the Fellowship of the Blessed, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed by that Phrase, <hi>Matth.</hi> 25.41. <hi>Go ye Cursed:</hi> And the Infliction of the greatest Evil, that is, Communion for ever with the Devil and his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, signified by the words following, <hi>into everlast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Fire prepared for the Devil,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                     <p n="16">XVI. The Place of this Punishment in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is frequently called Hell, and sometimes <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henna</hi> (Matth. 5.22.) a Fiery Furnace (<hi>Matth.</hi> 13.42.) The place of Torment (<hi>Luke</hi> 26.28.) The bottomless Pit (<hi>Rev.</hi> 9.1.) The Lake of Fire, or Lake burning with Fire and Brimstone (<hi>Rev.</hi> 20.15. and 21.8.) But where the same is, or shall be sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuate, since the Scriptures are silent, we are not to be Inquisitive.</p>
                     <p n="17">XVII.

<pb n="104" facs="tcp:208153:58"/>of so many as should be effectually called and lay hold thereon; And so to display the Riches of his unbounded Mercy; yet at the same time with full satisfaction to his Justice, in their Salvation.</p>
               <p n="1">I. This Divine and Wonderful Expedient for the Restauration of Man, is call'd, <hi>The New Covenant</hi> (because by it we are renewed.) The Covenant of Grace, Life and Salvation: <hi>The New Testament,</hi> and the Gospel; that is to say, <hi>Glad Tidings;</hi> Or a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Contract, which God was pleased of his own Free Grace to enter into with Man after the Fall, for restoring him to Favour and a state of Everlasting Happiness by the means of a Redeemer and Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.21. <hi>viz.</hi> by sending his only begotten Son (the Second Person of the adorable Trinity) into this World to assume our nature, and therein by perfect Righteousness and Obedience in his most Holy, Exemplary Life, and full Satisfaction to the Justice of God by his Death, obtain everlasting Life for all that should truly Believe in him.</p>
               <p n="2">II.

               </p>
               <p>That <hi>Adam</hi> did from this Promise look to Christ by an Eye of Faith for deliverance, may be gathered from the Name, which then, and not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he gave his Wife, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.20. He called her

And this Faith, no doubt, he taught his Posterity; for so the Apostle, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.4. tells us, <hi>By Faith</hi> Abel <hi>offered a Sacrifice;</hi> which must be Belief in the Person signified by that Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice: For his Sacrifice in all probability was accompanied with humble Thanksgiving to God for making that gracious Promise, and devout Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titions for the hastning the fulfilling thereof, and the appearance of that Seed whereby he was to be Redeemed; And that he considered the demerit of his own sin, as deserving the Wrath of God and Eternal Death, which his Sacrifice, being but the Blood of a Beast, was not able to take away, but did typically refer unto, and represent the <hi>Messiah;</hi> this the very Nature of his Sacrifice, which was bloody, and the Character which the Apostle gives of his Faith, plainly intimates. But as for <hi>Cain,</hi> he did not act Faith in the promised Seed, but only brought of the Fruits of the Ground as a Present, not a bloody Sacrifice, and so the same was not a signification of his Sin, nor any way a Type of Christ's Suffering, he owning God only as a Creator, without any respect to him as a Redeemer, and therefore God had no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to his Offering.</p>
               <p n="3">III. This Covenant was renewed afterwards to <hi>Abraham,</hi> and the Redeemer's Descent (accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Flesh) appropriated to his Posterity.

                  <hi>In thee shall allh te Families of the Earth be Blessed,</hi> Gen. 12.3. And then Circumcision was instituted to be as a Seal thereof: The time of the Mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>festation of the Messiah is intimated by <hi>Jacob, Gen.</hi> 49.10. <hi>The Scepter shall not depart from</hi> Judah, <hi>nor a Lawgiver from between his Feet, until</hi> Shiloh <hi>come.</hi> When the Law was given to the <hi>Israelites,</hi> the Ceremonial parts had a reference unto, and was to shadow out Christ's Death, and taking away our Sins: To <hi>David</hi> was vouchsaf'd a more special Promise, That the Saviour should be of his particular Family; and so, as Light encreases from the first Dawning more and more, till the Sun appears above the Horizon, so as the Accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plishment grew nearer, there were more ample Discoveries thereof made by the several Prophets, and the time very exactly measured out, when they were to expect him, by the Prophet <hi>Daniel.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">IV. Accordingly in the <hi>Fulness of time</hi> (that is, at that time determined by God and foretold by his Prophets) <hi>viz.</hi> very near 4000 years from the Creation, and now about 1689 years ago, the Eternal Son of God did become the Son of Man, by assuming to himself a true Body and a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable Soul, being conceived by the Power of the Holy Ghost in the Womb of the Blessed Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> and born of her, yet without Sin, and so continueth to be God and Man, in two distinct Natures, inseparably united in one Person for ever. <hi>There is one God and one Mediator between God and Man, the Man Christ Jesus,</hi> 1 Tim. 2.5. <hi>The
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:208153:59"/>Word was made Flesh, and dwelt amongst us,</hi> John 1.14.</p>
               <p>The mighty work of <hi>Reconciliation</hi> could not be effected, unless he that was to be the Mediator between God and Man, were conjoin'd to, and of the same Nature with either party, and consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly both God and Man: For that he should be God was requisite in respect of both Parties; on the one side, the Majesty of God required it; on the other side our Wants; the greatness of the Evil that was to be removed, and of the Good that was to be restored: That he should be Man was no less necessary; the Divine Nature could not suffer, and without shedding of Blood there could be no Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission of Sin, <hi>Hebr.</hi> 9.22. And the strictness of God's Justice required that the same Nature that sinned should suffer. The Eternal Son of God therefore took our Nature. 1. That he might suffer Death for us, and thereby satisfie Divine Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice, and pay a sufficient Ransom for Sin. 2dly. To Sanctifie our Nature. 3dly. That we might have Access with greater boldness to the Throne of Grace. <hi>Forasmuch as the Children are partakers of Flesh and Blood, he also himself took part of the same, that through Death he might destroy him that had the power of Death, which is the Devil,</hi> Hebr. 2.14. <hi>We have an High Priest that cannot be touched with feeling of our Infirmities, but was in all points tempted as we are, yet without Sin; let us therefore come boldly to the Throne of Grace,</hi> Hebr. 4.15.</p>
               <p n="5">
                  <pb n="108" facs="tcp:208153:60"/>V. This our <hi>Melchisedech,</hi> as he had no Mother in respect of one of his Natures, so he was to have no Father in regard of the other, but must be born of a pure and immaculate Virgin, without the help of any Man; which was necessary, as for other respects, so for the exemption of the assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med Nature from the imputation and pollution of <hi>Adam</hi>'s Sin: For Sin having by that one Man en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred into the world, every Father becometh an <hi>Adam</hi> unto his Child, and conveyeth the corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his own Nature unto all those whom he doth beget; therefore our Saviour assuming, in truth, the substance of our Nature, but not by the ordinary way of natural Generation, is thereby freed from all taint of the corruption of our flesh; and so being made <hi>of Man,</hi> but not <hi>by Man,</hi> and becoming the immediate Fruit of the <hi>Womb,</hi> and not of the <hi>Loins,</hi> must be acknowledged to be <hi>that Holy Thing,</hi> which born of the Blessed Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin, was indeed, and properly to be called <hi>the Son of God,</hi> Luke 1.35.</p>
               <p n="6">VI. How this wonderful Connexion of two so infinitely differing <hi>Natures</hi> in the <hi>Æ²nity of One Person,</hi> was effected, we are not curiously to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire, it being far above the Comprehension of our shallow Capacities; therefore in the Ark of the Covenant, the Faces of the Cherubims, <hi>Exod.</hi> 37.9. were directed to be towards <hi>the Mercy Seat,</hi> (the Type of our Saviour) to intimate that these are the things which the Angels desire to look into,
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:208153:60"/>1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.12. Only this we may safely say, and must believe, that as the distinction of the Persons in the Holy Trinity, hindreth not the Unity of the Nature of the Godhead, althÃ´ every person intire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly holdeth his own incommunicable properties, so neither doth the distinction of the two Natures in Christ any way infringe the Unity of his Person, althÃ´ each Nature remains intire in itself, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineth the properties agreeing thereunto, without any Conversion, Composition, Commixion, or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion.</p>
               <p n="7">VII. All the Actions and Passions of Christ are referr'd to his <hi>Person,</hi> as their proper term; and hence arises <hi>The Communication of Properties,</hi> or that manner of speaking which we often find in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, attributing the Properties of one Nature, either to the whole Person, as when Christ is said to have <hi>died,</hi> which was only proper to the Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Nature, and to have been in the <hi>Beginning,</hi> which is proper to the Divine; or to the other Nature for the Person, as when God is said <hi>to be received up into Glory,</hi> 1 Tim. 3.16 and <hi>Cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.8. which do not properly agree to the <hi>Divine Nature,</hi> but only the <hi>Humane.</hi> Or when the Properties of the whole person are attributed to <hi>either Nature,</hi> as, when the <hi>Man Christ is said</hi> to be the Mediator between God and Man, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.5. which yet agrees not to Christ as Man, but as he is both God and Man. And the Reason of all this is, because as both Natures truly subsist in Christs Person, so the Properties of both Natures are common to him.</p>
               <pb n="110" facs="tcp:208153:61"/>
               <p>But Note, we must here distinguish the use of the concrete words, <hi>God, Man,</hi> from those in the Abstract, God-head, Man-hood: For those be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to the Person, these to either Nature. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore tho we may truly say, God is Man, and Man is God, yet we cannot say, that the Deity is the Humanity, or the Humanity the Deity.</p>
               <p n="8">VIII. That the <hi>Messiah</hi> is come, and that Jesus Christ born of the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> is he, we prove against the <hi>Jews.</hi> 1. Because the places in which it was foretold by the Prophets, he should be born and Educated, Teach and Suffer, are long since <hi>laid waste,</hi> and no more known; as also the time in which, according to the Prophetical Oracles, he was to come, is past; for we read he was to be born in <hi>Bethlehem,</hi> Mich. 5.2. to be Educated in <hi>Nazareth,</hi> Isai. 11.1. to enter <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> whilst the second Temple stood, <hi>Zach.</hi> 9.9. <hi>Hagg.</hi> 2.7, 9. The Scepter not being totally departed from the <hi>Jews, Gen.</hi> 49.10. within 70 (Prophetical) Weeks, that is to say, 490 Years, from the time of the going forth of the Commandment, to rebuild <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem,</hi> after the <hi>Babylonish</hi> Captivity, <hi>Dan.</hi> 9.24. But <hi>Bethlehem, Nazareth, Jerusalem,</hi> and the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond <hi>Temple,</hi> are long since destroyed, the Scepter totally departed from <hi>Judah, Daniels</hi> Weeks (howsoever interpreted) accomplished; therefore the <hi>Messiah</hi> must needs be come. Secondly, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause all these and other Prophecies relating to the Messiah were exactly fulfilled in Jesus of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zareth,</hi> as by comparing them with the Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lists,
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:208153:61"/>and Chronology will appear. Thirdly, From the mighty Miracles which he performed, the perfect Holiness of his Life, the power of his Resurrection and Ascension, and that pure Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Doctrin which he left to the World, and which (notwithstanding all Persecutions) does yet survive and continue attested with the Blood of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numerable Martyrs.</p>
               <p n="9">IX. The <hi>History of Christ</hi> both in the state of his Humiliation, that is to say, his Incarnation, Birth, submission to the legal Ceremonies, Perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutions in his Infancy, Obedience to his Parents, Baptism, holy, humble Life, going about Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Gospel for the Salvation of Souls, and at the same time healing Infirmities of the Body; and Lastly, his bitter Agonies, being betray'd, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferted, scourged, contemn'd, and most cruel and ignominious Death; As also, in the state of his Exaltation, <hi>viz.</hi> his Resurrection, whereby he Triumph'd over Death, his giving forth Commissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to his Disciples to Preach the Gospel to all Nations, his glorious Ascension into Heaven, and sitting at the right Hand of God, is sufficiently set forth by the Holy Evangelists and Apostles Wherewe learn,</p>
               <p n="10">X. That the Offices of Christ are three-fold, <hi>Prophetical, Sacerdotal,</hi> and <hi>Regal.</hi> 1. He is our Prophet to make known to us the whole Will of his Father, in the performance where of we shall be sure to be accepted and rewarded by him. (For
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:208153:62"/>it was the work of a Prophet of old, not only to Foretell, but to Teach, and thence the Apostle calls Preaching, Prophesying) And this he did in those many Sermons and Precepts we find set down in the Gospel, and continues to perform the same by his Word and by his Spirit. 2. He is our Priest in once offering up himself a Sacrifice on the Cross to satisfie Divine Justice for our Sins, and in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king continual Intercession for us. He sits on the right Hand of God, and makes Request for us, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.34. 3ly. He is our King in the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his Church, and prescribing Laws there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto; in subduing us to himself by his Grace, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by ruling and defending us, restraining and final<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vanquishing all his and our Enemies.</p>
               <p n="11">XI. Christ is our <hi>sole and only Mediator and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercessor,</hi> and by that once offering up of himself upon the Cross made a full satisfaction for the sins of all those that believing in him, do heartily bewail and forsake them â Christ was once of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd to bear the sins of many, <hi>Hebr.</hi> 9.28. We are Sanctified through the offering of the Body of Jesus Once for all, <hi>Hebr.</hi> 10.10. By one offering Christ hath perfected for ever them that are San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified, <hi>v.</hi> 14. There is no more offering for sin, <hi>v.</hi> 18. Christ hath once suffered for Sins, that he might bring us to God, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.18.</p>
               <p>Hence it appears, That the modern Doctrin of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> which Teaches, That in the Lord's Supper (which they call <hi>the Mass</hi>) the the Minister is <hi>properly a Priest,</hi> and doth <hi>offer up
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:208153:62"/>Christ's Body and Blood, as a Sacrifice to God for obtaining the Pardon of Sin, and the Remission of Pain and Guilt for the Living and the Dead,</hi> is contrary to Scripture, and injurious to that All-sufficient Sacrifice of Christ.</p>
               <p>Indeed a real outward <hi>Sacrifice</hi> is against the Nature of a <hi>Sacrament,</hi> especially the <hi>Supper of the Lord;</hi> for one end thereof is to shew forth or keep in Memory the Sacrifice of Christ; besides, in a Sacrament God <hi>gives</hi> Christ to us; whereas in a real Sacracifice God <hi>receives</hi> from Man; and so in the <hi>Roman</hi> Sacrifice of the Mass, the Priest pretends to give Christ to God.</p>
               <p>If it be objected, That they acknowledge Christ is the Chief High Priest, but that themselves are <hi>secundary</hi> Priests, and offer their Sacrifices in sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serviency to his.âIt may be answer'd, Either they offer the <hi>very same</hi> Sacrifice, which Christ offered on the Cross, or another: If they offer an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, then they go point blank contrary to the before recited Scriptures. If the same, then these Absurdities will follow. 1. That Christ offered <hi>for himself;</hi> for these offer <hi>for themselves.</hi> 2. Whereas in our Lords Oblation the Priests and Sacrifice was the <hi>same thing,</hi> they must therefore be a Sacrifice at least in the second place. Nor can we admit their distinction of a <hi>Bloody</hi> and <hi>unbloody Sacrifice,</hi> for so there will not be <hi>one Sacrifice,</hi> which thwarts the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Texts, and Remission should be obtained by <hi>an unbloody Sacrifice,</hi> which the Apostle expresly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, <hi>Hebr.</hi> 9.12.</p>
               <pb n="114" facs="tcp:208153:63"/>
               <p>If they say, That there is but one Sacrifice of Redemption and Expiation for Sin, and that was the Sacrifice of the Cross, but that there are other Sacrifices of <hi>Application,</hi> to apply that to us. <hi>Answer,</hi> This distinction is frivilous; who ever heard of one Plaister made to apply another? Or a Ransom paid the second time to apply the former Payment? Certainly the <hi>Word</hi> and <hi>Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi> and Spirit of Christ, entertain'd with <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Obedience,</hi> are sufficient to apply Christ's <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="12">XII. As Christ by his perfect Righteousness and Sufferings hath purchased for us <hi>everlasting Life,</hi> so one main end of his coming into this World, and of his very Death, was to plant and promote <hi>Good Life, Righteousness, and Holiness</hi> amongst Men. He came to call Sinners to Repentance, <hi>Matth.</hi> 9.13. God sent his Son Jesus to bless us, in turning every one of us from our Iniquities, <hi>Acts</hi> 3.26. <hi>Who gave himself for our Sins, that he might Redeem us from all Iniquity, and purifie to himself a peculiar people, zealous of Good Works,</hi> Tit. 2.14. <hi>therefore let every one that calleth on the Name of the Lord</hi> [that is, that expects any bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit by Christs Passion] <hi>depart from Evil: For with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Holiness, no Man shall see God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="13">XIII. Our Justification is an Act of God, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he Acquitteth every penitent and believing Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, by not imputing to him his Sins, and imputing to him the perfect Satisfaction and Righteousness of Christ.</p>
               <div type="note">

                  <head>Where Note,</head>
                  <p n="1">1. That to <hi>Justifie</hi> in Scripture, does not signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie to Punish, nor yet to infuse inherent or habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Righteousness; but imports to absolve, or pronounce a person <hi>acquitted</hi> or discharged from some Guilt or Accusation, as <hi>Prov.</hi> 17.15. He that JUSTIFIES the <hi>Wicked, and he that condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the Just, are both an Abomination to the Lord,</hi> so <hi>Deut.</hi> 25.1. They <hi>shall justifie the Righteous and condemn the Wicked,</hi> in both which places, as also <hi>Rom</hi> 8.33, 34. <hi>Who shall lay any thing to the Charge of God's Elect? It is God that justifieth, who is he that condemneth?</hi> It is taken for a <hi>Judicial Sentence</hi> opposed to Condemnation: Now as to Condemn is not the putting any Evil into the Nature of the party Condemned, but the pronouncing of him Guilty, and binding him to Punishment; so Justifying is the Judges Declaration, that the Law is satisfied, and the Person quitted from Guilt and Punishment.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That the Righteousness for which the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever is Justified, is in Christ by <hi>Inhesion,</hi> in us by <hi>Imputation. But of him are ye in Christ, who of God is made unto us Wisdom and Righteousness, and San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification and Redemption,</hi> 1 Cor. 1.30. <hi>Abraham believed God, and it was accounted</hi> [or Imputed] <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him for Righteousness:</hi> For to him that worketh is the Reward not reckon'd of Grace, but of Debt. But to him that worketh not, but believeth on him that Justifieth the ungodly, his Faith is counted for Righteousness, even as <hi>David,</hi> who describeth the Blessedness of the Man unto whom God will
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:208153:64"/>impute Righteousness without works, saying, <hi>Blessed are they whose Iniquities are forgiven, and whose Sins are cover'd. Blessed is the Man to whom the Lord will not impute Sin,</hi> Rom. 4.3. &amp;c. <hi>A man is not justified by the works of the Law, but by the Faith of Jesus Christ,</hi> Gal. 2.16. <hi>I account all things loss and dung that I may gain Christ, and may be found in him, not having my own Righteousness, which is by the Law, but that which is by the Faith of Christ, the Righteousness which is of God by Faith,</hi> Philip. 3.8.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. That Christ alone Justifies us <hi>Meritoriously:</hi> Faith alone <hi>instrumentally,</hi> and God works <hi>declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively.</hi> For when we say we are justified by Faith, we mean no more than that we are justified by Christ's Merits apprehended by Faith; and Faith is said alone to justifie in respect of Works; which are necessary Effects, not Causes of Justification: For they do not precede in him that is to be justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but follow; or to speak more strictly, always accompany every one that is justified: For tho' justifying Faith be never alone, but joyned with good Works, yet it alone is the Instrument where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by we lay hold on Christ's Merits, and so are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tituled unto Justification. For as the Sun is not in Heaven alone, yet it alone makes the day; so tho' true Faith is never alone, but always worketh by Love, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.6. yet we must distinguish Justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication from Sanctification, looking upon the latter as a necessary Effect, but not as the Cause of our Justification: For Sanctification (as the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newal of our Nature, by mortifying the old Man,
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:208153:64"/>and instead thereof living to God, or the produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of Habits of Righteousness in us) being on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly begun in this Life and imperfect, how can it justifie us in the sight of God? Therefore tho' both Justification and Sanctification go together, yet they are differently to be considered, as Heat and Light are always conjoyn'd; yet we cannot say, that the Light burns the Wood, but only the Heat. Thus the Righteousness whereby we are justified, is inherent in Christ for us; this of San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification in us from him; the one follows from the Merit, the other from the efficacy of the Life and Death of Christ: In the one, Faith is only as an Hand, receiving; in the other as a co-work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Vertue. The one is in all Believers at all times alike; the other wrought differently and by degrees; and tho' the end of both be Eternal Life, yet the one is <hi>inter Causas Regnandi,</hi> a Cause of Reigning, the other only as <hi>Via ad Regnum,</hi> the way to the Kingdom.</p>
                  <p n="14">XIV. As this inestimable benefit of Justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation is applied unto, and apprehended by us through Faith, so Faith is a firm Assent to the Truth of the whole Word of God, and therein, especially such a fiducial Reception of, and Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance on the Promises of Reconciliation, freely given through and for the sake of Christ our Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator, as causeth the Soul to embrace the same on the Terms offered in the Gospel, and build its Eternal Happiness thereon. <hi>Or</hi> [in the words of the Church of <hi>England</hi> in the Homily of Faith]

                  <head>Here Observe,</head>
                  <p n="1">1. That our Blessed Saviour was, and still is <hi>The Rock</hi> on which the Universal Church, both be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore and since his coming (Incarnate) into the World, was built. He was promised presently after <hi>Adam</hi>'s Fall (as we shewed before) <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.15. And then successively by all the Prophetsâ <hi>God hath raised up an Horn of Salvation for us, as he spake by the Mouth of his Holy Prophets, which have been since the World began,</hi> Luke 1.69, 70. Begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning at <hi>Moses</hi> and all the Prophets, he expounded to them through all the Scriptures the things con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning himself, <hi>Luke</hi> 24.27. His Death was a Propitiation as well for the Sins of those who lived before, as ours who live after it. For this, cause he is the Mediator of the <hi>New Testament,</hi> that by means of (His) Death for the Redemption of the Transgressions that were under the first Testament, <hi>They which are called might receive the Promise of Eternal Inheritance,</hi> Hebr. 9.15. Those Promises of the <hi>Messiah</hi> being such as all the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarchs, Prophets, and Pious Men before Christ did know and believe. <hi>These all died in Faith, not having received the Promises, but having seen them afar off, were perswaded of them, and embraced them,</hi> Heb. 11.13. Hence <hi>Job</hi> saith, <hi>I know that my Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer liveth, and that he shall stand at the latter day upon the Earth; and tho' after my skin worms destroy this body, yet in my Flesh I shall see God,</hi> Job. 19.25, 26. So the Apostle, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.8. tells us, <hi>That the Gospel was Preached unto</hi> Abraham: And testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies, <hi>Acts</hi> 26.22. <hi>That he Preached no other things
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:208153:67"/>than those which the Prophets and</hi> Moses <hi>did say should come.</hi> The difference only is, That they believed in the Messiah that was to be exhibited; We in Christ actually manifest: Their Faith was more imperfect and implicit; ours (since he is come, and the Gospel clearly publisht, much more perfect and explicite.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That the Greek word <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>ã in non-Latin alphabet ã</desc>
                     </gap>, which we render <hi>Church,</hi> is derived from the Verb <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, which signifies to <hi>call forth,</hi> being used by the <hi>Grecians</hi> for those legal, orderly Assemblies of the Citizens, when they were called from their private Houses by the publick <hi>Cryer</hi> to meet so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly in a Body, in order to the hearing some Vote or Law pass'd by the Senate; from which secular sense it is most fitly translated to signifie, the Assembly of those whom God by the Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of his word (the Heralds of his Gospel) does call out of the World into the Kingdom of his SonâBut</p>
                  <p n="3">3. This Word <hi>Church</hi> in Scripture, is some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times taken strictly for the multitude of True Believers only; sometimes more largely for the Body of all those that own themselves Christians; and this either in some one City or Country, call'd a <hi>particular Church,</hi> or diffused throughout the World, and therefore called <hi>the Catholick</hi> or <hi>Æ²ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal Church;</hi> in which sense it comprehends <hi>Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites</hi> as well as those that are truly Pious; and therefore in the definition above, I added the words, <hi>Profess to Worship God through Christ.</hi>

                     <pb n="123" facs="tcp:208153:67"/>II. The Church of God, according to its seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral parts, is to be considered, either as <hi>Trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant,</hi> that is to say, those that have already at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd their Crown in Heaven; or <hi>Militant, viz.</hi> Those that are still fighting against, and wrast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling with, the World, the Flesh, and the Devil, here on Earth: And this latter is said to be either <hi>Invisible,</hi> consisting only of the Elect, <hi>The Lord alone knows who are his,</hi> 2 Tim. 2.19. Or <hi>Visible,</hi> that is, The whole Company of all that are call'd in common, and profess Faith in Christ whether they be sincerely obedient or not.</p>
                  <p n="3">III. The Church in respect of its Members con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists of <hi>Bishops,</hi> and <hi>Pastors,</hi> and of the <hi>People</hi> or <hi>Flock;</hi> and the former are to have a peculiar, law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Call or Ordination to that Work. <hi>Christ gave some Apostles, and some Prophets, and some Pastors, and Teachers, for the perfecting of the Saints, for the work of the Ministry, for the Edifying of the Body,</hi> &amp;c. Ephes. 4.11. <hi>No man taketh this Honour to himself, but he that is called of God,</hi> Heb. 5.4.</p>
                  <p>But here Two <hi>Queries</hi> may arise.</p>
               </div>
               <div n="1" type="query">
                  <head>Query. 1.</head>
                  <p>
                     <hi>What are we to understand, when in the Creed we say,</hi> I Believe the Catholic Church?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ans.</hi> The word <hi>CATHOLIC</hi> is originally Greek, and signifies as much in <hi>English</hi> as <hi>Whole</hi> or <hi>Æ²niversal.</hi> And so <hi>Catholic Church.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">
                     <pb n="124" facs="tcp:208153:68"/>1. Most properly signifies the <hi>whole</hi> Church of God Triumphant and Militant, or the Universal Company of the Elect, even as many as ever shall be saved; who are all but <hi>one Body</hi> knit together in one Faith, under one Head, <hi>viz.</hi> the Lord Jess Christ, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.28. <hi>For ye are all one in Christ,</hi> Eph. 4.4. <hi>There is one Body and one Spirit, even as ye are called in one Hope:</hi> And this is the sense of the word in the Creed, <hi>I believe the holy Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Church,</hi> that is to say, I firmly believe, that notwithstanding all the Endeavours of Satan or his Instruments, this Holy Elect Company shall remain and be compleated; and not only, That there is such a Church in general, but that we our selves appertain to it. This <hi>Catholick Church</hi> is frequently styled in Scripture the Body and Spouse of Christ, as also the Universal Assembly <hi>of the first born written in Heaven,</hi> Heb. 12.23. <hi>Jerusalem which is above, the Mother of us all,</hi> Gal. 4.26. Of whom therefore that famous saying of St. <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prian</hi> is most properly to be understood, <hi>How can he have God for his Father, that hath not the Church for his Mother?</hi> At least that he meant it not of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> is evident, because himself at the same time stood out in opposition to her, and wrote against her Bishop. So St. <hi>Agustine</hi> in his Tract <hi>De Catechizandis Rudibus, Cap.</hi> 12. speaks thus, <hi>All they that be Holy and Sanctified, which are, have been, and shall be, are Citizens of Heavenly Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem.</hi> And <hi>Gregory,</hi> a Pope, in his Morals, <hi>Lib.</hi> 28. <hi>Cap.</hi> 9. says, <hi>All the Elect are embraced in the Bosom of the Church, and all the Reprobates are without.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">
                     <pb n="125" facs="tcp:208153:68"/>2. The Epithet <hi>Catholic,</hi> when joyned to <hi>Church</hi> in a less proper sense, is used to express only the <hi>Visible Militant Church,</hi> and seems first to have grown into general use (tho' I remember it not in Scripture) in the Primitive times, to denote the <hi>Extension</hi> of the Church of God, as no longer con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined to the <hi>Jews;</hi> but, the Partition-wall (as the the Apostle speaks, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 2.14.) <hi>being broken down, universally spread abroad in every Nation</hi> (Jew or Gentile) <hi>where the Gospel was preacht and entertain'd;</hi> and thus it comprehends all the <hi>seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Churches</hi> on the face of the Earth, as of <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem, Antioch, Britain, Rome,</hi> &amp;c. and all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians in those Churches, whether <hi>sincere</hi> or <hi>Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites,</hi> that make an outward Profession of Faith, as all the Boughs of a Tree, however spread and scatter'd one from another, and some <hi>dead</hi> and withering whilst others flourish, are united in one common Stem, tho' not equally deriving <hi>Sap</hi> from the <hi>Root.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. In this <hi>latter</hi> Signification, as all the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Churches in the World are denoted, so when the <hi>Donatists</hi> about the Fourth <hi>Century</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to hold erroneous Opinions, and withal to confine the Church of God to those of their own Sect in a corner of <hi>Africk,</hi> St. <hi>Augustine</hi> and others frequently urged against them, <hi>That the Church was Catholic;</hi> (that is, <hi>Æ²niversal,</hi> not coop'd up to their narrow Limits) and maintain'd a sounder Doctrin: whence it came to pass, That tho' the more ancient Fathers never used this Term, <hi>Catholic,</hi> to distinguish the pure Churches from the
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:208153:69"/>Heretical, but called the former <hi>Orthodox,</hi> that is, holding the right Doctrin; yet in process of time by reason that the <hi>Orthodox</hi> Churches held and maintained the Church of Christ to be <hi>Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic</hi> or Universal; these two words <hi>Catholic</hi> and <hi>Orthodox,</hi> were taken in one and the same signifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation. Nor was it incongruous; for whatsoever Churches did faithfully keep intire that Gospel that had been Preached by the Apostles <hi>every where,</hi> and which being Truth, was to continue for <hi>all times,</hi> might justly be entituled <hi>Catholic</hi> Christian Churches. And in this sense a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Church as 'tis <hi>Pure and Orthodoxal</hi> may be call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a <hi>Catholic Church,</hi> tho' not <hi>The Catholic Church,</hi> and is more or less <hi>Catholic</hi> proportiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly as its more or less pure.</p>

                     <p>No, not in the <hi>First;</hi> For then all the Faithful under the Old Testament, and vast numbers of Churches and Christians since, and at this day, far exceeding for multitude her Members, that never were nor are of her Communion (that is, never own'd themselves subject to the <hi>Pope</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> as the alone <hi>Visible Head</hi> of the Church, which with them is the Characteristic Mark of being of their Church and necessary to Salvation
<note n="*" place="margin">Vid. Extrav. C. Unam Sanctam &amp; Bellarm. de Eccles. Milit. l. 3. c. 2. &amp; 5.</note>) must
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:208153:69"/>be excluded from the Kingdom of Heaven. Nor will they, sure, pretend that all and every of their Members are undoubtedly saved, tho' they offer abundance more, and easier ways for that purpose than Almighty God has revealed in his <hi>Word.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2. Not in the <hi>Second;</hi> Because the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> ever was, and is a <hi>particular Church,</hi> and (when at best) but one Member of the Church <hi>Catholic.</hi> Which is so called, not that it is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways <hi>every where,</hi> but for that no Country is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded, nor any place <hi>priviledg'd.</hi> So that there may be a thousand Churches besides that of <hi>Rome;</hi> and no place being priviledg'd, even <hi>Rome</hi> it self may be cut off from the Church. For particular Churches may not only be Corrupted, but <hi>totally fail</hi> and Apostatize. For tho' they may be called <hi>Catholic</hi> as long as they hold the Primitive Faith intire, yet that imports not, that a <hi>Catholic,</hi> that is, in this sense an <hi>Orthodox</hi> Church must always be where once it has been: For in what a condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion now are the once famous Seven Churches of <hi>Asia?</hi> Where are the Churches of <hi>Carthage?</hi> Of <hi>Hippo, &amp;c.</hi> And therefore <hi>Vincentius Lyrinen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sis</hi> justly takes a difference between a Catholic in <hi>place</hi> and in <hi>time. If</hi> (says he) <hi>any new Infection goes on to corrupt not a part, but the whole Church, then must we cleave to Antiquity.</hi> And again, <hi>That Church is</hi> Catholic <hi>which holds the Religion which hath been ever hitherto embraced.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="3">
                        <pb n="128" facs="tcp:208153:70"/>3. Neither can the present Church of <hi>Rome</hi> in the <hi>Third</hi> sense be properly styled <hi>Catholic:</hi> For thereby is meant a <hi>pure Church</hi> that holds entire the Ancient Primitive Doctrin delivered by Christ and his Apostles, without any Corruptions that may endanger or overthrow the same. But we know and can prove, That <hi>she</hi> is deeply Guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of altering and diminishing Christ's Ordinances, adding to the Scriptures and Sacraments, intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing and imposing as necessary for Salvation divers Doctrins and Practices that have no ground in Scripture, and were unknown to the Primitive Church. Nay, as for truly Christian and Apostolical Antiquity (the only root and essential Character of Catholic Doctrin) they cannot name any one Article proper to their own <hi>Roman Faith,</hi> that is in this sense <hi>True</hi> or <hi>Ancient;</hi> and as for those Articles which they hold in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon with us, 'tis sad to consider how they abuse them, and subvert the whole design of the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel by the intermixture of their peculiar <hi>Roman Ones.</hi>

                     <p>Tho' this Notion of calling a particular Church, <hi>Catholic,</hi> from a supposed Power of Empire over all other Churches, be very odd, and altogether unknown to Antiquity, yet the greater difficulty
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:208153:70"/>is in the <hi>Thing</hi> it self, how it can be made appear, That the <hi>Roman</hi> Church has any such Power. For,</p>
                     <p n="1">1. There is not the least ground or colour for it in Holy Scripture; and how could the Apostle say, <hi>That he had revealed the whole Council of God,</hi> if so important a point, so absolutely necessary (as they pretend) for preventing <hi>Schisms,</hi> crush<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Errors, and preserving Unity and Truth, were concealed and left in the dark? But so far silent are the Scriptures herein, that the whole New Testament, where there is mention of so many other Churches by Name, has not any such words as <hi>The Church of Rome</hi> For tho' we are satisfied there was a Church there (and very famous too, for its vigour of Faith and Piety) yet this omissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Calling it so in Divine Writ, may seem de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed as a Curb to its fore-seen future Usurpati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. As the Church or Bishops of <hi>Rome</hi> for se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral hundreds of Years never <hi>claimed</hi> nor <hi>exerted</hi> this Power (for as for their swarms of pretended <hi>decretal Epistles,</hi> they have long since by all Wise Men been exploded as <hi>spurious</hi>) so it was unknown to, and unheard of amongst the Primitive Churches and Fathers: As for instance, St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> and St. <hi>Agustine,</hi> who are strict for keeping close to the <hi>Catholic Church,</hi> are yet jealous at the same time, against submitting themselves or their Churches to the pleasure of that of <hi>Rome.</hi> How insolent were most of the Fathers towards the Bishops of <hi>Rome</hi> of their times, if they believ'd them their
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:208153:71"/>
                        <hi>Monarchs,</hi> to treat them in so familiar a stile, as that of <hi>Their Brethren and Fellow Servants,</hi> and no more? When did St. <hi>Chrysostome</hi> or St. <hi>Basil</hi> swear Cano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical Obedience to his Holiness? How much <hi>Money</hi> did they send to <hi>Rome</hi> when they obtain'd from thence their Episcopal Pall? Nay, did not Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> himself 600 Years after Christ, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press his abhorrence of the Title of <hi>Æ²niversal Bishop,</hi> as a mark of <hi>Antichrist?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="3">3. We have the Testimony of another that was afterwards <hi>Pope</hi> himself, That before the <hi>Nicene Council</hi> other Christian Churches <hi>little regarded</hi> (by way of Observance as to a Superior) <hi>the Roman Church</hi> [<hi>Aen. Sylvius Epist. L.</hi> 1.] And all the World may know how shamefully (or rather shamelesly) two <hi>Canons</hi> were forged on that <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cene</hi> Council, by the Bishops of <hi>Rome,</hi> to colour their designed Usurpation in the matter of Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peals, and detected by the Council of <hi>Carthage</hi> about the Year 418.</p>
                     <p n="4">IV. The Head of the Universal Church is the Lord Jesus, and he only and alone. God hath given Christ to be Head over all things to his Church, which is the Body, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.2. As the Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band is the Head of the Wise, so Christ is the Head of the Church, <hi>Eph.</hi> 5.23. This also appears from the Properties of the Head, as to be highest, to prescribe Laws, <hi>James</hi> 4.12. To convey the Power of Life and Motion into all the Members; and lastly to be the Saviour of the Body, <hi>Eph.</hi> 5.23. All which solely appertain to Christ.</p>

                        <pb n="131" facs="tcp:208153:71"/>V. Christ invested all his Apostles with equal Power and Authority. For</p>
                     <p n="1">1. They were all immediately called by him to their Apostleship (except <hi>Matthias,</hi> who of two that were nominated by the common consent, not only of all the Apostles, but also of all the other <hi>Brethren,</hi> being about 120 in number, <hi>Acts</hi> 1.15. and 23. was chosen by Lot.)</p>
                     <p n="2">2. They <hi>all</hi> had their Commission immediately from <hi>him,</hi> and therein the very same power given to them <hi>all.</hi> So it was when first, <hi>before</hi> his Passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, he sent them to the <hi>Jews only, Mark</hi> 3.14. He ordained Twelve, that they might be with him, and that he might send them out to Preach, <hi>Matth.</hi> 10.1.6, and 7. When <hi>he had called his Twelve Disciples, he gave them power over un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean Spirits,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>And commanded them, saying,</hi> &amp;c. So likewise it was, when after his Resurrection they had Commission given them to Preach <hi>to all Nations;</hi> for we read <hi>Matth.</hi> 28.16, 19, and 20. He appointed <hi>all the Eleven</hi> to meet him at a Mountain in <hi>Galilee,</hi> and said to them (all joynt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and severally) <hi>All Power is given unto me in Heaven and in Earth, Go YE therefore, Teach all Nations,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>And lo!

                     </p>
                     <p>Hence 'tis evident, all were equally called, all e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually sent, all equally impower'd; no difference nor distinction of Persons as to any Priviledge or Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periority above the rest; no degree of Jurisdiction or Authority more or greater in one than every

                     <p>The former part of this may be a true Note of the present Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> but not of the Church of Christ, who placed no such Head as the Pope over his Church, but is himself its Head, with whom all true living Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers have Union and Communion. The latter part cannot be attribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the Church alone; For there are many that confederate in Evil, and there is a sort of Union amongst the Devils, <hi>Mat.</hi> 12.8. Nor is it truly applicable to the Modern Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> there being many and considerable dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences amongst its Members, as for Instance, Whether the Pope be above a Council, or a Council above the Pope? and in which of the two Infallibility resides, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                     <p>Of this Antichrist the Scripture gives us this <hi>graphical Description</hi> following,</p>
                     <p n="1">1. The Mystery of this Antichrist is said to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin to work in the Apostles times, 2 <hi>Thess.</hi> 2.7. 1 <hi>John</hi> 4.3. (that is, the Seeds already began to be sown, whence in time he should arise) but he should not be revealed, till after he that letteth (which by Interpreters is generally understood of the <hi>Roman</hi> Emperor) were taken out of the way, 2 <hi>Thess.</hi> 2.7. And that he should not be totally de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed till at or near Christ's second coming; whence it undeniably follows, That this Anti-christ cannot be any one only individual person, (for how then should he so long continue?) but as 'tis usual in Scripture under a single Name or Form to represent the whole Race of such a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom or Monarchy, as <hi>Dan.</hi> 7. <hi>Rev.</hi> 13. so here it signifies a certain state or order of men, one for the most part at a time, but many by succession carrying on the same design after each other.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. He is raised by Satan, 2 <hi>Thess.</hi> 2.9. his coming shall be with the power of Satan, <hi>Rev.</hi> 13.4. The Dragon gave him power, whereas otherwise Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates are raised by God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13.2. <hi>&amp;</hi> 3.</p>

He sits in the Temple of God, that is, in the Church; But yet really is a bitter Enemy to Christ and his Church, 1 <hi>John</hi> 4.5. He denieth Christ to be come in the Flesh (that is, by the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quel of his Doctrin) and makes War with the Saints, <hi>Rev.</hi> 17.6. He hath Horns like the Lamb, <hi>Rev.</hi> 17.11. that is, arrogates to himself that which belongs to Christ, but he fights against the Lamb, <hi>vers.</hi> 14. All which is agreeable to the notation of the word Antichrist: For the Preposition, <hi>Anti</hi> may be <hi>Englisht</hi> either against, or, for, and instead of; in which last sense 'tis used, <hi>Matth.</hi> 7.27. <gap reason="foreign">

He sits as God, and exalts himself above every thing that is called God, <hi>Rev.</hi> 18.7.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. The Seat of his Empire is in that great City, which (in the time of St. <hi>John</hi>) Reigned over the Kings of the Earth, <hi>Rev.</hi> 17.18. Situate on 7 Hills, and that has been under 7 Hills, and that

               <head>CHAP. VII. <hi>Of the Sacraments. That there are but Two establisht in the New Testament. Of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism; Of the Lord's Supper; Of Transub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantiation; Touching, Receiving in both Kinds.</hi>
               </head>
               <p n="1">I. THE Sacraments of the New Testament are not only Notes or Marks of our Christian Profession, but rather certain Testimonies and <hi>efficacious Signs</hi> of the Grace and Good Will of God toward us, by which he invisibly works in us, and not only enlivens, but likewise confirms our Faith in him. Or Ordinances of God, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in by giving and receiving of outward Symbolical Elements, according to his Will, the Promises of Grace made in the Blood of Christ being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presented, exhibited and applied unto us, are fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Signed and Sealed between God and Man, for the strengthning of our Faith, and bringing us more effectually to the Practice of God's Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments: Or more briefly, <hi>Signs divinely Insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted, that declare, seal, and in their right use exhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit the Grace of God in Christ to Believers.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. The Word <hi>Sacrament</hi> which of old was used for a Military Oath, entred into by Soldiers to their General; and sometimes for Money depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sited as a Pledge by those who were in Suit at
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:208153:82"/>Law, is not unfitly applied in the Church to the signs of Grace: For by the Sacraments, as it were by solemn Oaths we are bound to observe what is promised and required in the Covenant on our parts; and the same are to us as pledges of Grace promised in the Covenant on Gods behalf: And therefore if the Word be not expresly found in Scripture, yet the things thereby designed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing found there, it may properly and convenient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be used.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It is also called <hi>A Mystery,</hi> as it signifieth a Secret and Divine Thing proposed in Signs and Types; yet the word Mystery reaches further than the word <hi>Sacrament,</hi> for tho' every Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment be a Mystery, yet all Mysteries are not Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments.</p>
               <p n="2">II. The Sacraments of the New Testament are only Two, <hi>viz.</hi> Baptism and the Lord's Supper. The first, of the admission of God's Children into the Church, there to be partakers of an everlast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Communion with Christ. The second, of their Preservation and Nourishment therein, to assure them of their continual increase in Christ; in which respect the former is once only; the latter often to be adminstred and received.</p>
               <p>That there are no more Sacraments appears,</p>
               <p n="1">1. Because these Two Seals assure us of all God's Graces; As of our Regeneration and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grafting into Christ, so of our growth and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance in himâª <hi>We are all Baptized into one Body, and have been all made to drink into one Spirit,</hi> 1 Cor.
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:208153:83"/>12.13. As in the bodily Life we need no more but to be born, and then to have this Life preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved; so our Birth in Christ being represented by Baptism, and our Nourishment after that New Birth, by the Lords Supper, there is no need of any other Sacraments.</p>
               <p n="2">2. In every Sacrament (according to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per acceptation of the Word in Divinity) there are five Conditions required. 1. That it be Insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted by Christ himself immediately. 2. That it have some sensible Element or Sign. 3. That it have the Promise of God concerning saving Grace and Eternal Life added to the Sign. 4. That it represent, and to worthy Receivers seal and apply Christ and the Benefits of the New Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant. 5 That it be given to the whole Church to continue to the end of the World. But these Conditions agree only to those two Sacraments which we have mentioned: Not to confirmation Penance, Orders, Extream Unction, or Matri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, which some would have to be Sacraments of the Gospel, thereby to compleat the number of Seven.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Nor were there any other esteemed as pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Sacraments of the Gospel by the Primitive Churches or Fathers. <hi>Peter Lombard</hi> the School<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, who Flourish'd but about the Year 1140, being the first Man that ever presum'd to fix the number <hi>Seven;</hi> nor was the same generally re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd or establisht by any Council, until that of <hi>Florence,</hi> which ended but in the Year 1439.</p>
               <p n="4">
                  <pb n="155" facs="tcp:208153:83"/>4. Tho' with Antiquity we justly disown the other Five to be proper Sacraments, yet as to the things themselves, we retain and make use of them (all but one) to such good ends and purposes as they serve for: For 1. As touching <hi>Confirmati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> see the Office appointed for it in the Liturgy, which duly observ'd, does tend much more to the promoting of Knowledge and Godliness than as 'tis practised in the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> 2. Nor do we attribute the Title of <hi>Sacrament</hi> to <hi>Holy Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders</hi> (or the calling of Persons to the work of the Ministry) because they belong not to the whole <hi>Church,</hi> but to some particulars, which we ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge ought to be undertaken and conferr'd with the greatest Caution, Reverence, and So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnity, both in the <hi>Ordainers</hi> and those Ordained. 3. Touching <hi>Matrimony,</hi> tho' we grant that it is capable of a signification of the <hi>Mystical Æ²nion</hi> between Christ and his Church; and that it is an <hi>Honourable State</hi> instituted by God in Paradise, yet we cannot count it a <hi>Sacrament;</hi> for then a Sacrament of the Gospel should be common to <hi>Heathens;</hi> for with the same Apostle we judge it to <hi>be Honourable in all Men,</hi> and particularly that it may lawfully be undertaken by the Ministers of the Gospel as well as other Christians; St. <hi>Peter</hi> himself being a <hi>Married Man,</hi> and others of the Apostles, as is intimated by St. <hi>Paul: Have we not power to lead about a Sister, a Wife, as well as other Apostles and Cephas?</hi> 1 Co. 9.5. A Bishop must be blameless, the <hi>Husband of one Wife,</hi> 1 Tim. 3.2. <hi>Their Wives must be grave and sober,</hi> v. 11.
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:208153:84"/>Forbidding to <hi>Marry</hi> is branded as a Doctrin of Devils, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.3. And we cannot but admire the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> should at the same time ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance it to a <hi>Sacrament,</hi> and yet so severely for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid all her Clergy the use of it, and reckon them a more Holy sort of persons that make <hi>Vows</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst it. 4thly. Touching <hi>Penance,</hi> tho' we do not with the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> exact from people that unnecessary, or indeed impossible Task of <hi>a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Confession</hi> to the Priest of all private Sins as absolutely necessary to Salvation; nor send them on long Pilgrimages to this or the other Image; nor to give themselves so many Lashes, or mum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble over so many <hi>Pater Nosters</hi> or <hi>Ave Maria</hi>'s without either Understanding or Devotion (which external Drudgeries signifie very little to amend the Soul, but rather tend to destroy it by leaning on such <hi>Formalities</hi>) yet we press them to the great and indispensible Duties of sincere <hi>Repentance</hi> and <hi>Reformation,</hi> without which they cannot be pardoned; And that they should confess their Sins to God with shame and sorrow, and speedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and throughly forsake the same; as also advise them, when they find their Consciences burthened or perplext, to impart their condition to the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister for Direction and Comfort; and in some cases of notorious, open, scandalous Offences, a <hi>public Penance</hi> is enjoyned, and a general Confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion and Absolution prescribed in our Liturgy. Lastly, As for <hi>Extream Æ²nction,</hi> as 'tis practis'd in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> it has no Warrant from Scripture, for the <hi>anointing</hi> mention'd, <hi>Mark</hi> 16.13.
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:208153:84"/>or <hi>James</hi> 5.14. was intended for the Health of the <hi>Body,</hi> and the usage seems to have ceased with the Gift of <hi>Miracles;</hi> but they pretend it for the benefit of the Soul, and therefore use it not commonly till they perceive no hopes of Reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very; for which Ceremony, as there is no Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of God, so neither any promise of Spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Benefit thereby, but the same is attended with much Superstition, and, we fear, betrays many a poor Soul (depending on it) to Destruction.</p>
               <p n="3">III. The Efficacy of the Sacraments depends not upon the Intention of the person that Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters them, but upon the work of the Spirit, and the word of Institution, containing a precept for the use of them, and a promise of the benefit by them. <hi>Neither is he that planteth any thing, nor he that watereth, but it is God that giveth the Encrease,</hi> 1 Cor. 3.7.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Romanists</hi> by making the Efficacy of the Sacraments depend on the Intention of the Priest, [See, Council of <hi>Trent, Sess.</hi> 7. <hi>Can.</hi> 11. and the common Opinion of their Doctors] do suspend their Faith and Salvation upon great Uncertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; For as they hold, That they cannot be faved without Baptism: So they also hold, That the external Act of Baptism is no Baptism, if the Priest did not intend to make it a Sacrament; And how on they be sure of the Priest's Intentions? Nay, thus they cannot be sure that they have any Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments or Priests amongst them, for they must be Infallibly certain that he is a Priest that Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secrates,
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:208153:85"/>and that he hath an Intention to make a Sacrament. But how can they be assured of his Priesthood? They must first be assured of the Priesthood of him that Baptized him, and of the Bishop that Ordain'd him, and of the Archbishop that Ordain'd, and of the real Intention of all the Three; which is impossible, so that accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to their own <hi>Principles</hi> the people have no cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty that they are Christians.</p>
               <p n="4">IV. Nor do the Sacraments confer Grace by the meer Work done, or Sacramental Action. We grant the Sacraments are not meer Signs, but Efficacious to Work Grace, if they be rightly used; not by the meer work done, but by the power and operation of the Spirit, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.13. <hi>Matth.</hi> 3.11. As <hi>Elisha</hi>'s Bough made Iron to swim, or <hi>Moses</hi>'s Rod divided the Red Sea, not by inherent Vertue in it self, but by the Power of God. Nor is the Efficacy of Sacraments tied to that moment of time, wherein they are admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stred, <hi>John</hi> 3.18. But they become effectual means of Salvation to such only as by Faith receive them, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.21. Baptism doth Save, not by putting away the Filth of the Flesh, but the Answer of a good Conscience, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.28, 29. <hi>Let a man examin himself, and so let him eat of this Bread and drink of this Cup. For he that eateth and drinketh unworthily, eateth and drinketh his own Damnation.</hi> We are not to think that the Sacramental Signs, as Water in Baptism, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> tho' joyned with the words of Institution barely pronounc'd, have in
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:208153:85"/>themselves inherent Vertue to work and produce Grace, as Physick to cure, or Fire to burn; For such a Conceit is, 1. Injurious to God, for he only who made the Heart can sanctifie it; the cleansing of the Soul by Grace being as great a work as Creation. 2dly. The word Preached doth not Profit without Faith, therefore not the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments. 3dly. Did the Sacrament confer Grace upon <hi>Judas?</hi> Or did <hi>Simon Magus</hi> receive Grace by Baptism? St. <hi>Peter</hi> testifies the contrary, <hi>Acts</hi> 8.13. compared with <hi>vers.</hi> 23. We may therefore conclude with that Axiom of St. <hi>Augustine, Non Sacramentum, sed Fides Sacramenti Justificat.</hi> We are not Justified by the Sacrament, but by the Faith of the Sacrament.</p>
               <p n="5">V. The principal ends for which God hath In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituted the Sacraments, are 1. To help our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sight as clear Glasses, for so the Apostle tells the <hi>Galathians, That before their Eyes</hi> [that is, in the Sacrament] <hi>Christ had been evidently set forth, Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified amongst them,</hi> Gal. 3.1. 2dly. To relieve our Memories as lasting Monuments, <hi>Luke</hi> 22.19. <hi>This do in Remembrance of me,</hi> 1 Cor. 11.26. <hi>As often as ye eat this Bread and drink this Cup, ye do shew forth the Lords Death till he come.</hi> 3dly. More especially to confirm and strengthen our Faith, as most certain Seals and Pledges, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.11. Whereby, 4thly. they become our Bonds of Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, and the Marks and Badges of our Profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion; so that in short, they were appointed, and are to be made use of for the clearing of our
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:208153:86"/>Knowledge, for the helping of our Memories, for the strengthening our Faith, and for the quickning of our Obedience.</p>
               <p n="6">VI. Baptism is the first or initial Sacrament of the New Testament, by which those that rightly receive it, are admitted into the visible Church, and the Priviledges thereof; the washing of Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter by our Lord's Institution, not only represent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Powerful washing away of our Sins by the Blood of Christ, but also confirming and visibly sealing the Promises of Regeneration and Adop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; in which we are buried with Christ, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.3. and die to Sin by vertue of his Death, and rise again to newness of Life by the power of his Resurrection. Whence 'tis called, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.21. [<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>ã in non-Latin alphabet ã</desc>
                  </gap>] the Sti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulation of a good Conscience towards God, or a mutual Contract; because as God thereby ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits and receives a person into his Church, and Seals unto him the Covenant of Grace, so the party Baptized does solemnly Vow, and Seals it by undertaking that Ordinance, <hi>To forsake the World, the Flesh, and the Devil, and to Live to Christ and the Glory of God in Obedience, Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and Holiness.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="7">VII. This Sacrament was brought into the Church at the Commandment of God (<hi>John</hi> 1.13.) by the Ministry of <hi>John,</hi> therefore call'd the <hi>Baptist</hi> (<hi>Mat.</hi> 3.1.) but after wards sanctified and confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by our Saviour Christ himself, being <hi>Baptized</hi> by
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:208153:86"/>
                  <hi>John</hi> (<hi>Matth.</hi> 3 13.) and giving Commission to his Apostles and Ministers to continue the same in his Church to the Worlds End, <hi>Matth.</hi> 28.18.</p>
               <p n="8">VIII. The outward Matter of this Sacrament is only <hi>Water,</hi> there being a natural fitness there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in to express the inward invisible Mysteries there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by signified. For,</p>
               <p n="1">1. Water is a necessary Element; the Natural Life of Man cannot be without it, and the Blood of Christ is as necessary to his Spiritual Life.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Water is a Refreshing Element, <hi>The Hart panteth after the Water Brooks,</hi> Psal. 42.1. The Thirst of the Body cannot be quenched but by Water (or that which proceeds from it) whence the height of Misery is described by a barren and dry ground, where no Water is, <hi>Psal.</hi> 63.1. So the Thirst of the Soul cannot be quenched but by the Blood of Christ, <hi>Joh.</hi> 4.13.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Water is a free, cheap, obvious, common Element, easie to come by without Cost; any may go to the River and drink. So is the Blood of Christ, <hi>Isai.</hi> 51.1. <hi>Ho! He that thirsteth come and drink freely.</hi> 'Tis offered as generally to All, Rich and Poor, High and Low, Bond and Free, every one may lay claim to, and have an interest in it, <hi>John</hi> 1.12. Whoever receiveth, whoever believeth the Proposal, is without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straint, none can say I am shut out or excepted.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Water is a copious and plentiful Element, there is no less in the River for thy drinking of it; so is the Blood of Christ All-sufficient, an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>exhaustible
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:208153:87"/>Fountain of Grace and Salvation; of his Fulness we may all receive, and yet he be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the more empty; whence the Scripture speaks of plenteous Redemption.</p>
               <p n="5">5. More especially Water is a cleansing and a purifying Element, and it resembles the Blood of Christ fitly in that; For the Blood of Christ cleanseth us from all Sin, 1 <hi>John</hi> 1.7. Which therefore was long before expressed by the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet under the name of Water, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36.25. <hi>I will sprinkle clean water upon you, and you shall be clean from all your filthiness.</hi> For as in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the Spirit moved on the Waters, and was the cause of Generation, so in the Baptism of Water and the Spirit, is effected our Regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.</p>
               <p>But besides all this, we must have an Eye to God's Divine Institution, appointing and ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this Element to typifie to the Soul Christ Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified in his cleansing Quality; For otherwise, tho' there were never such an aptness in the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, yet it ought not to be made use of in the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, unless the Lord do specially appropri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate it to such a purpose; And then with God's Institution there goeth a Blessing, and a peculiar Power and Vertue attends on a Divine Ordinance. That which makes the outward Signs significant, being God's Word and Appointment, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we cannot allow of <hi>Oyl, Salt, Spittle,</hi> &amp;c. which the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> uses and enjoyns in this Sacrament, because they are the meer Inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and Additions of Men.</p>
               <p n="9">
                  <pb n="163" facs="tcp:208153:87"/>IX. <hi>Baptism,</hi> tho' administred but once, is of a continual use throughout a Christian's whole Life: Its vertue and efficacy loseth not its strength by time. In all thy Doubts and Fears, look back to thy Baptism, and the Promises of God sealed up unto thee there: Lay hold on them by Faith, and thou shalt have the actual Comfort of thy Baptism, and still feel the sweet effects of it. In all thy failings, slips, and revolts, to recover thy self have recourse to thy Baptism New Baptism shall not need, the Covenant and Seal of God standeth firm, he changeth not; only renew thy Repentance, renew thy Faith in those blessed Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises of Grace, sealed to thee in thy Baptism; renew thy Vows then entred into, and renew thy Resolutions to observe them more strictly for the future, and thou shalt find it of wonderful Efficacy and Comfort to thy Soul.</p>
               <p n="10">X. THE LORD's SUPPER (so called 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.20. because our Lord sitting at his last Supper Instituted it the Evening before he suffer'd) is the other Sacrament of the New Testament, wherein God, by the signs of Bread and Wine, sanctified according to Christ's Appointment, and rightly received by the Communicant, doth signifie, seal, and spiritually exhibit to Believers the Body and Blood of Christ, broken and shed for their sakes, whereby they are nourished and assured of their growth in Grace unto Eternal Life.</p>
               <pb n="164" facs="tcp:208153:88"/>
               <p>This Ordinance is also called by a Metony my of the Effect, THE COMMUNION, <hi>viz.</hi> of the Body and Blood of Christ, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.16. of which worthy Receivers are therein partakers, as also because the Members of the Church are there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by more firmly United one to another in Charity. 2dly. Thence it was also anciently term'd <hi>Synaxis,</hi> the coming together or Assembly; for as that was one main end of their solemn Religious Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies, so they all generally communicated (which condemns the <hi>Roman</hi> private Masses, where none receives but the Priest.) 3dly. By a Metonymy of the Subject 'tis styled <hi>The Lord's Table,</hi> 1 Cor. 10.21. And 4thly. sometimes the <hi>Eucharist</hi> (by the Ancient Fathers) that is to say, <hi>Thanksgiving,</hi> because the rendring of Thanks to God, always accompanied it. But that it was, or ought to be called either <hi>The Mass</hi> or <hi>Sacrament of the Altar,</hi> we find not in Scripture, nor in the Genuine Writings of the purer Ages of the Church.</p>
               <p n="11">XI. The external Matter of the Lord's Supper are the visible Signs, <hi>viz. Bread</hi> and <hi>Wine;</hi> which being the chiefest means of Man's Corporeal Suste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, <hi>Psal.</hi> 104.14. were most aptly made choice of to represent our Spiritual Nourishment. The inward or heavenly Matter is the thing sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified, to wit, Christ and all the Benefits of his Passion and Mediation; and whilst the Sign is given by the Minister, the Faithful do actually re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the thing signified; For we deny not the Presence of Christ, or of his Body or Blood in the
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:208153:88"/>Action of the Sacrament, for besides that he is present in his Divine Person, he is not wanting in the presence of his Spirit to his own Body and Blood, not locally, but <hi>Sacramentally.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For you are to observe, That there is a three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sold Presence, besides that which is local, <hi>viz.</hi> 1. <hi>Symbolical,</hi> when things are represented to the mind by some Sign or Symbol, as things by words or voices, Man by his Image. 2. Spiritual, when we represent to our Selves by Faith; some Spiritual thing, either not yet existent, or not lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally present; so <hi>Abraham</hi> saw Christ's day, <hi>John</hi> 8.58. 3dly. Vertual, when that which is distant in place, is present in Power and Efficacy, as the Sun. These three ways of Presence meet in the <hi>Sacrament.</hi> For the Body and Blood of Christ are present to us. 1. Symbolically, as they are represented by an external Sign. 2dly. Spiritually, as we apply by Faith to our selves Christ's Body and Blood, with his Merits. 3dly. Vertually, as we perceive the Fruits thereof in our Hearts. The first degree of Sacramental Presence belongs to all, the second and third to the Faithful only. Therefore tho' Christ's Body by local presence is as far distant from the Symbols, as Heaven is from Earth, yet there is a Sacramental Presence: Presence not being opposed to Distance, but to Absence.</p>
               <p n="13">XIII. The Sacraments are not therefore bare empty Signs, because the Symbol, and thing signified are not locally united, or there remain notwithstanding, 1. The Signs <hi>Signifying.</hi> 2. <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibiting.</hi> 3. <hi>Applying.</hi> 4. <hi>Sealing.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="166" facs="tcp:208153:89"/>
               <p>For Signs are either significant only, as a Paint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Image signifieth a Man; or exhibiting also, as a Sceptre, Keys, a Turf of Earth, and such like, which being exhibited, Regal Power is also con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr'd, and leave to enter the House, and Pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session granted of the Premises; Or they are ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying Signs, as that Promise of God to preserve the 144000, <hi>Rev.</hi> 7.3. which the Angel applied to each one, by setting a mark on his Fore-head. Or, Lastly, they are confirming Signs, as Ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nests, Seals, and such like. Now these four sorts of Signs meet in the Sacraments. For 1. The outward Symboles do signifie and represent Christ's Body and Blood. 2dly. Together with the Sign, the thing signified is exhibited; yet not in the Sign, but in the Sacramental Action; the Minister exhibiting the Sign, and Christ the thing signified is exhibited. 3dly. The thing signified, generally promised to the Faithful in the Gospel, by the exhibition of the Sign, is applied to each Believer. 4thly. The same Promise is confirmed by the Sacraments; whence they are not only call'd Signs, but Seals also, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.11.</p>
               <p n="13">XIII. From this Union and Relation of the thing signified, to and with the Sign there ariseth a Sacramental Phrase or Speech, in which the thing signified is spoken of the Sign; but such manner of Speech expresses what these outward Signs signifie, rather than what they are in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, or of their own Nature.</p>
               <pb n="167" facs="tcp:208153:89"/>
               <p>Thus, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.9. Circumcision is called <hi>The Covenant,</hi> but <hi>vers.</hi> 11. properly <hi>The Sign of the Covenant.</hi> So <hi>Exod.</hi> 12.11. The Lamb is called <hi>The Passover;</hi> and the like saying is used <hi>Luke</hi> 22.1. and <hi>vers.</hi> 8, 11, 12, 15. In the same sense are all those places to be understood in which <hi>Expia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> is attributed to <hi>Sacrifices,</hi> and Purification to Water and Washings. In the same manner, in Instituting this <hi>Sacrament, While they were eating, Jesus took Bread, and when he had Blessed, brake</hi> IT, <hi>and gave</hi> IT <hi>to his Disciples, saying, Take, Eat,</hi> THIS <hi>is my</hi> BODY; <hi>likewise taking the Cup, and having given Thanks, he gave to them, saying, Drink ye</hi> ALL <hi>of THIS, for THIS is the Blood of the New Testament,</hi> &amp;c. Matth. 26.26, 27, and 28. So 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.4. The <hi>Rock</hi> was <hi>Christ.</hi> Nay, the very same is seen in other Speeches, besides Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramental, as <hi>Gen.</hi> 41.37. The <hi>Seven Cows</hi> are <hi>Seven Years,</hi> Rev. 17.9. The <hi>Seven Heads</hi> are <hi>Seven Hills,</hi> and <hi>vers.</hi> 12 <hi>The Ten Horns</hi> are <hi>Ten Kings.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now where-ever things of <hi>different Natures</hi> are affirmed or joyned by the coupling of the Words, such Speech must needs be either false or tropical; whereas then the word <hi>is,</hi> in this saying, <hi>This is my Body,</hi> conjoyns things of different Natures, to wit, <hi>Bread</hi> and Chrin's <hi>Body;</hi> either the Speech must be <hi>false,</hi> which to say is <hi>Blasphemy;</hi> or else <hi>Tropical,</hi> as indeed it is, the meaning and true Interpretation thereof, and of all such Speeches being plain. <hi>Bread</hi> is the <hi>Body of Christ;</hi> that is, <hi>a Sacrament</hi> of his Body; Circumcision is God's
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:208153:90"/>Covenant, that is, a Sign or <hi>Sacrament</hi> thereof, <hi>Seven Kine</hi> are <hi>Seven Years,</hi> that is, <hi>Types and Figures</hi> of <hi>Seven</hi> Years, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="14">XIV. The Bread and Wine in this Sacrament are not changed in nature, but in use. For the words of eating and drinking do properly belong to those outward Elements, and by a borrowed Speech are said of the Body and Blood of Christ, to note unto us the Communion we have with our Saviour, of whom we are as verily partakers by a Lively Faith, as of the Bread and Wine by eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and drinking them. And thus we say, That these Elements are changed in use, because being separated from a common use, they are Consecrated to Sign and Seal unto us our Spiritual Nourish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Growth by the Body and Blood of Christ Jesus (<hi>Luke</hi> 22.19. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.3, 4. (For as the Sacrament of Baptism doth Seal to us a Spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Regeneration, so the Lord's Supper, a Spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Feeding. And even as well the Body and Blood of Christ is in Baptism given us for Cloathing, as they are given in the Lord's Supper for Nourish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment Therefore the Bread and Wine are not the true proper Body and Blood of Christ, but the signs and tokens of them as in Baptism, the water was only a sign of Christ's Blood, not the Blood it self.</p>
               <p n="15">XV. VVe cannot therefore admit, nor ought to believe the Doctrin of the Carnal Presence, or Transubstantiation, which is made a prime Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:208153:90"/>of Faith in the <hi>Roman Church,</hi> viz. <hi>That in the Sacrament of the Lord's Supper</hi> (or <hi>Mass,</hi> as they call it) <hi>the whole substance of the Bread and Wine, is by the words of Consecration, truly, really, and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantially turned into the Body and Blood, together with the Soul and Divinity of our Lord Jesus Christ, and so into whole Christ, without any of the substance of Bread and Wine remaining.</hi> [These are the words of their Council of <hi>Trent, Sess.</hi> 13. <hi>C.</hi> 4. and <hi>Can.</hi> 1. and 2.]</p>
               <div type="arguments">
                  <head>Arguments against Transubstantiation.</head>
                  <p n="1">1. As for that saying <hi>This is my Body,</hi> if these <hi>Romanists</hi> will abide by the strict litteral words, they make nothing for their Transubstantiation; for he that says, <hi>This is my Body,</hi> does not say, <hi>This is Transubstantiated into my Body.</hi> And if in any usual intelligible sense it may be his Body without this Notion of Transubstantiation, then cannot Transubstantiation be from thence infer'd. Now the sense will be very usual and intelligible, if the words be taken figuratively, as much as to say, <hi>This Bread signifies, represents, or exhibits my Body;</hi> for the like figurative Expressions are fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent in Scripture, as we shewed before, <hi>Article</hi> XIII. To which we may add, That Christ is said to be a <hi>Door, John</hi> 10.9. A <hi>Vine,</hi> nay a <hi>true Vine, John</hi> 15.1. So Believers are said to be all <hi>one Bread,</hi> 1 Cor. 10.4. And 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.27. <hi>Ye are the Body of Christ.</hi> Now will any Man in his Wits argue from these Texts, That our Blessed
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:208153:91"/>Saviour was substantially a Rock? or a Vine? or that the <hi>Corinthians</hi> were Transubstantiated into the Body of Christ? If not, why will he strain this one Text to a sense alike absurd?</p>
                  <p>Especially since this figurative way of speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is rather to be expected in the Institution of a <hi>Sacrament;</hi> the very nature of which is to repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent and exhibit some invisible Grace and Benefit by an outward sign and figure; Nor can it be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied, but Christ in the Institution of this very Sacrament useth figurative Expressions, which cannot be taken strictly and literally, as, <hi>This Cup is the New Testament in my Blood,</hi> &amp;c. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as therefore the <hi>Romanists</hi> urge that it is absurd to conceive tropical Phrases which are obscure, in Christ's last Will and Legacy. 1. Their Supposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is not true, that tropical Phrases are obscure, for we use Tropes often to illustrate, there being many times greater light and a more lively Idea carried to the mind by a borrowed, than in a proper Speech. 2dly. It is also a mistake that Tropes are not used in Wills and Testaments, for <hi>Jacob</hi>'s Will shews the contrary, <hi>Gen.</hi> 49. And <hi>Moses</hi>'s, Deut. 33. And themselves are forc'd to grant a Trope in these words, <hi>This Cup is the New Testament.</hi> Indeed it was impossible that the Disciples should understand these words, <hi>This is my Body,</hi> literally, because they not only saw, felt, and tasted, that what he gave them was Bread and Wine; but saw likewise as plainly, that it was not his Body which was given, but his Body which gave that which was given; not his
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:208153:91"/>Body broken and his Blood shed; because they saw him alive at that very time, and beheld his Body whole and unpierced, therefore they must needs understand him, as we do, <hi>Sacramentally,</hi> having been used to the like Expressions in the Scriptures, as is evident by the many Texts here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in before cited to that purpose.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. St. <hi>Paul</hi> divers times calls it Bread, even af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Consecration, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. <hi>As oft as ye eat this</hi> BREAD <hi>and drink this Cup, ye do shew forth the Lord's Death till he come.</hi> Whosoever shall <hi>eat this</hi> BREAD, <hi>and drink this Cup of the Lord unworthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Christ's Body remains in Heaven, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is not here on Earth. <hi>Christ sits at the right Hand of God,</hi> Colos. 3.1. <hi>Whom the Heavens must contain until the Restitution of all things,</hi> Acts 3.21.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. It includes great Absurdities, As that Christ held his whole Body in his Hands, yea did eat himself whilst yet he sat whole and entire with his Disciples at the Table. That his Body must be in a thousand places at once, and his whole Body be much less in quantity than the least Limb of his Body, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> By all which they seem to vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late an Article of Faith, and in effect deny the verity of our Lords Humane Body.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. It subverts the Credibility of the Christian Religion, for that is mainly built on the Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles wrought by our Saviour and his Apostles, which depended on the senses of those that saw them, but if our senses may not be credited, touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:208153:92"/>their proper objects, but I must believe what my eyes, taste, feeling, and smelling inform me to be a Wafer or Wine, to be real substantial Flesh and Blood, where is the certainty of any Miracle? For a Miracle is only a supernatural Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect evident to sense.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. If the Bread be a very Body of Christ, then there will remain no sign of the thing signified, and so no Sacrament. For a Sacrament always consists of a sign, a thing signified, and the Analogy between them. Now if the Bread be the Body, the sign and the thing signified is the same, and so there can be no Analogy; to say the Accidents as whiteness, roundness, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> without the substance of Bread, are the sign, is absur'd, for such Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents do not nourish, nor can signifie Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

It introduces Idolatry, for the <hi>Romanists</hi> Adore and give Divine Worship to the Host or Sacrament, and require the same of all who have Communion with them: Now if this Opinion of Transubstantiation be not true (as we have shewed to be false) 'tis plain, and themselves cannot deny, but they are guilty of gross Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try; nor will it excuse them to say, They worship not the Bread but Christ, supposing the Bread to be Christ, for those Heathens that worshipped the <hi>Sun</hi> or <hi>Jupiter,</hi> did suppose them to be Gods. And if such a Plea were good, most Idolaters would be excused. But the Apostle teaches otherwise; <hi>When ye knew not God, ye did service to them which by nature are no Gods,</hi> Gal. 4.8.</p>
                  <p n="8">
                     <pb n="173" facs="tcp:208153:92"/>8. The Primitive Church knew nothing of this Transubstantiation; The Fathers mention it not, nay rather explode any such Conceit. St. <hi>Chryso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stom</hi> (in <hi>Epistol. ad Caesar. Monach.</hi>) saith, <hi>Before the Bread is consecrate, we call it (common) Bread, but the Divine Grace sanctifying it, 'tis taken off from the appellation of Bread, and accounted worthy to be called the Lord's Body, altho' the nature of Bread does therein remain</hi>âAnd again (in <hi>Opere im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfecto in Matth. Homil.</hi> 11.) he has these words, <hi>In the Sacrament, not the true Body of Christ, but the Mystery of his Body is contained.</hi> So St. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustine (contra Adimaent. c.</hi> 12.) <hi>The Lord doubted not to say,</hi> This is my Body, <hi>when he gave the sign of his Body.</hi> And yet more full and express is the same Father in his Book <hi>De DoctrinÃ¢ ChristianÃ¢,</hi> where delivering several Rules for the right un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding of Scripture, he gives this for one,

                     <p>One Error begot another. You must know that about the Year of our Lord 715, a fierce Dispute arose about Images; the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> and a Council held there, were for Images; but the <hi>Greek Church</hi> and a Council at <hi>Constantinople</hi> condemned them: The Popes were so hot and violent in this worthy Quarrel, that <hi>Gregory</hi> the Second Excommunicated the Emperour <hi>Philip,</hi> and <hi>Gregory</hi> the Third, the Emperour <hi>Leo</hi> the Third, because they opposed Images; And at last in the Second Council of <hi>Nice,</hi> about the Year 788, got Image-worship established.</p>
                     <p>Now one of the great Arguments of the before-mentioned Synod of <hi>Constantinople</hi> against Images was this, <hi>That our Lord Christ having left us no other Image of himself but the Sacrament in which the substance of Bread is the Image of his Body, we ought therefore to make no other Image of our Lord.</hi> To avoid the force of this Argument, the Bishops at the following <hi>Nicence Council,</hi> who were for Images, did declare, <hi>That the Sacrament after Consecration, is not the Image or Anti-type of Christs Body and Blood, but it is properly his Body and Blood.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This Doctrin being first broached on this oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion (which was in or about the Year 788) one <hi>Paschasius</hi> Abbot of <hi>Corbey</hi> about the Year 818, did much propagate and advance it in the <hi>Latin</hi> Church, tho' not without vigorous opposition, first by <hi>Rabanus Maurus</hi> Archbishop of <hi>Mentz,</hi> one of the most Learned and Eminent Men of that
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:208153:93"/>Age. And afterwards by <hi>Berengarius, Bertram,</hi> and others. But the Doctrin in it self making for the Honour of Priesthood, was eagerly em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced by most of the Clergy; and poor <hi>Beren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garius</hi> forced to Recant, first in a Council held at <hi>Rome</hi> by Pope <hi>Nicholas</hi> the Second, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards again under Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> the Seventh, about the Year 1079. And to declare, <hi>That the Bread and Wine are substantially changed into the true and proper Body of Christ, and after Conse cration are the true Body which was born of the Virgin, and did hang on the Cross.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But tho' they had invented <hi>the thing,</hi> I do not find they had got <hi>a name</hi> for it, till the Council of <hi>Lateran</hi> under Pope <hi>Innocent</hi> the Third, in the Year 1215, became its Godfathers, and call'd it TRANSUBSTANTIATION. So that from the first starting to the compleating of the Opinion, and establishing it for a general Article of Faith, was above 400 Years; and that too the most wretched time for Blindness and Ignorance that ever the Church labour'd under, and no wonder if whilst Christians were generally asleep, the evil one took advantage to sow his Tares; for in this dark period it was, that not only this, but most other Popish Errors (as Image-Worship, Purgatory, Indulgences, and Auricular Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) received, if not their rise, yet their main growth and reputation in the World.</p>

                     <p n="1">1. 'Tis evident that the eating and the drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing belong to the same Persons; If the one be restrained, so must the other; and since 'tis con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>confess'd, That eating belongs to the people by vertue of this Precept <hi>[Eat of it]</hi> by the same rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son doth drinking belong to them, by vertue of the Precept <hi>[Drink ye all of it.]</hi> 2dly. Tho' the Apostles were Ministers, yet in this Act they were in the peoples stead, and Christ was the Minister
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:208153:94"/>or Dispenser of this Sacrament. And as they were Ministers, he commanded them: <hi>Do this in remembrance of me,</hi> that is, take and distribute Bread and Wine to the People, as he had to them; and if they are commanded to give the Bread to the People, they are commanded to give the Wine also. 3dly. St. <hi>Paul</hi> clearly expounds, and applies this to all Believers; for having recited our Lord's words, thus he writes to all the <hi>Corin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians, Let a man examine himself, and so let him eat of that Bread, and drink of that Cup,</hi> 1 Cor. 11. Where in four verses he inseparably joyns eating and drinking together.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The Commemoration of Christ's Blood poured out at his Death, belongs to the Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of the Cup, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.25. but that Comme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moration ought to be made by all Laymen as well as Priests.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. To a Testament confirm'd by Death, none ought to add or diminish, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.15. But the partaking of the Cup by all, no less than the use of the Bread, is the Testament of Christ, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.25.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. If taking away one kind, takes away the thing signified by the Sacrament, and the Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy between the perfect Nutrition, by a Banquet Corporal and Spiritual, then the Communion ought to continue in both kinds; but the first is true, for Bread with Drink does not signifie a perfect Nourishment, nor can the Bread alone re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>present Christ's Blood shed for us.</p>

It is confessed by the most Learned <hi>Romanists</hi> That the whole Church of God (Lay and Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy) for about 1200 Years, received in both kinds, even the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> it self. This is attested by <hi>Lindanus (in PanopliÃ¢, L.</hi> 4. <hi>C.</hi> 56.) Cardinal <hi>Bona (de Rebus Liturgicis, L.</hi> 2. <hi>C.</hi> 18.) and others. Nay after that, in <hi>Thomas Aquinas</hi>'s time (who died in the Year of our Lord 1274, according to <hi>Trithemius</hi>) it was but in some Churches that the Cup was denied to the Laity [<hi>Aquinas, Part.</hi> 3. <hi>Quaest.</hi> 8. <hi>Art.</hi> 12.] And so the Famous Jesuit <hi>Gregory de Valentia (De Legit. usu Eucharist. C.</hi> 10.) owns that the custom of communicating in one kind began generally to obtain, even in the <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin</hi> Church, not long before the Council of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance,</hi> which was held in the Year 1414.</p>
                     <p>And remarkable is the Confidence of that Council, who not ignorantly, but with an express <hi>Non obstante</hi> to Christ's Institution, and the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of the primitive Church, deprived the people of half the Sacrament, for these are their words [<hi>Concil. Constan. Sess.</hi> 1.3.] <hi>Altho Christ Instituted and Administred to his Disciples this Venerable Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment under both kinds of Bread and Wine, and also in the Primitive Church it was received in both kinds; yet notwithstanding, for avoiding some dangers and scandals; this Custom is, upon reasonable grounds in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduced, that it be received by Lay-people under the kind of Bread only.</hi> And then they proceed to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare such as persist to maintain the contrary, shall be expell'd as <hi>Hereticks,</hi> and grievously pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisht; and enjoyn, <hi>That no Prtoest under pain of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication

                     <p>It may, possibly, be some satisfaction to the Reader, to know what were those frightful dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers and scandals mentioned in this Decree; Now <hi>John Gerson</hi> who was present at that Council and wrote in defence thereof, particularly nominates them, as follows. 1. <hi>Because the Liquor may by some causualty be spilt.</hi> 2. <hi>Because it cannot be car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried about amongst the People, but some will be apt to be pour'd over, for some may be troubled with the Palsie.</hi> 3. <hi>The Chalices or Vessels (which ought to be kept Sacred) will be defiled by being touch'd and han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dled by Lay-men.</hi> 4. <hi>The Laymen have long Beards on which some of the Consecrated Wine may stick.</hi> 5. <hi>In keeping it for the use of the Sick, it may in Winter freeze, and in Summer grow sowre and turn to Vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eager, or putrifie, and Worms (or Flies) be bred in it.</hi> 6. <hi>By that means, or by Diseased Persons drinking of it before, others may happen to loath it.</hi> 7. <hi>Some per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons do naturally nauseate Wine.</hi> 8. <hi>In some Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries Wine is not to be had, or not but at very chargea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble rates. Lastly, It would give occasion to the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to believe that which is false, as that Lay-people as to the receiving of the Sacrament, are of equal Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity with the Priests.</hi>

And therefore (having spoken of that which they call <hi>The Sacrifice of the Mass,</hi> before, <hi>Chap,</hi> 5. <hi>Art.</hi> 11.) shall hasten to some more usual Observations.</p>
                     <p n="18">XVIII. The outward matter or signs of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament of the Lord's Supper, are Bread and Wine; the inward matter is Christ, with all his Satisfaction and Merit.</p>

                  <head>Bread and Wine were Instituted to be the signs of Christ's Body and Blood, for the analogy, simili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, propriety, and effect that there is between the sign and thing signified.</head>
                  <p n="1">1. As touching the Bread.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. As Corporal Life is chiefly sustain'd by Bread, so by Christ (the true Bread) is the Soul nourish'd to Spiritual and Eternal Life.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. As Bread supplies the Hunger of the Body, so does the Merit of Christ that of the Soul.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. As Bread is useful and desirable only to those that Hunger, not to those that are full Fed; so the Vertue of Christ's Body profits only those
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:208153:96"/>that hunger after Righteousness; but those that are puft up with their own Righteousness, and seem to be full and need nothing, neither regard, nor obtain benefit by it.</p>

                  <p n="2">2. As Wine quenches our Thirst, warms the Body, and renders us more apt for the Functions of Life; so the Blood of Christ received by Faith, allays the Thirst of the Soul, excites it to Good Works, and enflames it with Charity or Love towards God and our Neighbour.</p>

Lastly, That all this may not be done slightly, but with seriousness that so important a matter re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires, it will be convenient to set apart some time, and withdraw himself from worldly Affairs, to meditate on these things for the raising up of his Soul to a devout and heavenly temper, fit to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:208153:98"/>such a gracious Mystery; giving himself to frequent Prayer with all zeal and earnestness, that God would fit and prepare him so, that he may not appear at this Nuptial Feast without having on a Wedding Garment.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>At,</hi> and <hi>during the time of Receiving,</hi> they ought to use all reverent attention, meditating on their own Unworthiness, and Christ's Sufferings, and his inestimable Love, <hi>Hereby perceive we the love of God towards us, because he laid down his life for us,</hi> 1 John 3.16. And to stir up their Souls to Love and Gratitude again to him for the same, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solving to give up themselves wholly to be go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern'd by him, and walk in Obedience to his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>After receiving,</hi> offer up with all possible Devotion Thanks and Praises for that great Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, and beg the Assistance of the Divine Spirit, for enabling thee to perform the Vow which thou hast now renewed and entred into; that the Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified Jesus, of whose Body and Blood thou hast been admitted to be partaker, would by the power of his Death subdue and mortifie all thy Corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. For after every participation of this Holy Ordinance, we must endeavour to find an encrease of our Faith in Christ, Love to God and his Saints, power to vanquish Sin, and practise Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience; a further Mortification of the Old Man, and so a greater measure of dying unto Sin; a further strength of the New Man, and so a greater care to walk more steadily in the ways of God all our days.</p>
                  <p>And if we receive no Refreshment by this Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:208153:98"/>Feast, we may justly suspect it is because some secret unmortified Lust remaineth in us, like <hi>Achan</hi>'s VVedge of Gold, some beloved sin (ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther not seen, or not sufficiently sorrowed for, and resolved against) lieth glowing in the Heart, which causeth God to frown upon our Services; in which case a Man ought to descend into him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, and make a more strict search into his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, that he may again come before the Lord with better preparedness, and God will, in due time, give Consolation to every one that unfeig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nedly seeketh after, and waiteth upon him in his Ordinances.</p>

               <head>CHAP. VIII. <hi>Of good</hi> Works, Merit, Supererogation, <hi>the</hi> Moral Law; <hi>A brief</hi> Comment <hi>on the</hi> TEN COMMANDMENTS.</head>
               <p n="1">I. THE study and practice of <hi>good Works,</hi> is throughout all the Scriptures most severe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly enjoyned, and they are absolutely necessary as the <hi>way</hi> and <hi>means</hi> to obtain everlasting life, thÃ´ not as the <hi>meriting Cause</hi> thereof.</p>
               <p n="1">1. This distinction is grounded on plain Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, for St. <hi>Paul</hi> testifies, <hi>That Eternal Life is the Gift of God,</hi> Rom. 6.23. Now a Gift is free, and cannot be merited, for then it werea purchase, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the same Apostle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.4. To him that works the Reward is reckon'd not of Grace, but of
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:208153:99"/>Debt: Christ alone is the Storehouse of our Merits; every true Believer is worthy not by his own Works, but in Christ, and by his Merits and Righteousness, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 2.8. <hi>By grace ye are saved through faith, and that not of our selves; it is the gift of God, Not of works, lest any man should boast.</hi> Tit. 3.5. <hi>Not by works of righteousness which we have done, but according to his mercy he hath saved us.</hi> For, 1. Our best works are imperfect; nay, St. <hi>Paul</hi> saith of himself, <hi>Though I know nothing by my self, yet am I not thereby justified,</hi> 1 Cor. 4.4. 2. There is a vast disproportion between them and the glory to come. 3. They are Debts which we owe to God, we are bound to do them; so that if we should do all, yet we must confess still <hi>we are unprofitable servants,</hi> Luke 17.10.4. As good, they are not our own, but proceed from the Spirit of God, thÃ´ they are done by us, yet they are not of us; <hi>We are not sufficient of our selves to think any thing as of our selves, but our sufficiency is of God,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.5. <hi>He works in us both the will and the deed.</hi> And what Merit can there be in paying an old Debt, especially when he to whom it is paid, lends us at present the money? 5. We do not profit God by them; <hi>If thou be righteous, what givest thou to God? or what receiveth he at thy hands?</hi> Job 35.7. Why then should we qualifie our imperfect due, borrowed, unprofitable works (unprofitable, I mean, in this respect, of justifying us in God's fight) with the arrogant title of Merits? To say, That Christ by his Death merited, that our works should merit everlasting life, is an unscriptural
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:208153:99"/>Expression, tending to represent our selves as Christ's Partners, and so, in effect, our own Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viours and Redeemers.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>But the word</hi> Reward <hi>is often mentioned in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, as</hi>âHe shall reward every man according to his works, <hi>Mat.</hi> 16.27. Great is your reward in Heaven, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.12. <hi>He had respect to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence of reward,</hi> Hebr. 11.26.</p>
                  <div type="answer">
                     <head>Answer.</head>
                     <p>There is a <hi>Reward of Mercy and Grace,</hi> and of <hi>Desert or Merit;</hi> the one may be of Bounty far above any thing due to the Party, but so is not the other. This is St. <hi>Ambrose</hi>'s distinction, [<hi>Epist. l.</hi> 1] <hi>There is</hi> (saith he) <hi>one kind of Reward of Liberality, and another of the wages of Vertues.</hi> Thus God rewards two ways, either in <hi>meer Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice,</hi> and so he rewards the wicked justly deserv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing damnation; or <hi>in Justice and Mercy both,</hi> and so he rewards sincere Believers; first in Justice, as well in respect of Christ's meriting Reward for such, as for that God having promised a Reward, will, in his Justice, perform it. But this is still also in mercy, both in respect of our selves de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serving no such Reward, and of the moving cause which was meerly his own good pleasure. Again, the Reward here is not promised to the work, but to the person, and 'tis not said for his works, as noting any cause of the Reward, but according to his works: For there are many other Rewards
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:208153:100"/>temporal and spiritual, which God may in some respect proportion to Mens virtues and zeal, thÃ´ yet Eternal Life (which is beyond all such pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion) be freely bestow'd for the alone merits of Christ, which being infinite, are only of an adequate value thereunto. And 'tis plain, <hi>Moses</hi> had respect to the recompence of Reward upon God's promise made, and not upon the merit of his own doing; for he makes not his own Act the procurer of the Recompence, but the certainty of the Recompence the Excitement to the work.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Hence appears the unfoundness of the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrin of <hi>Supererogation,</hi> that is, that we are able to do some good works more than by the Law are required, and thereby of putting (as it were) an obligation on Almighty God: For those that hold that Opinion, distinguish God's Commands from Evangelical Counsels; the former they make necessary, but the doing of the latter (a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst which they place their Vows of <hi>single Life, Poverty, Regular Obedience,</hi> &amp;c.) highly merito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, for that a Man is not bound to do such things; and therefore they think that such as do them shall have greater glory in Heaven, and insi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuate as if they could transfer such their <hi>overplus</hi> Merits, and thereby help others. But the Holy Scriptures tell us plainly, <hi>When you have done all, say you are unprofitable servants,</hi> Luke 17.10. <hi>How shall a man be just with God, if he will contend with him?</hi> Job 9.2. <hi>There is not a just man upon earth that doth good, and sinneth not,</hi> Eccles. 7.20. <hi>If we
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:208153:100"/>say we have no sin, we deceive our selves,</hi> 1 John 1.8. <hi>In many things we offend all,</hi> Jam. 3.2. The truth is, we are so far from being able to supererogate, that we cannot perfectly keep the Law, but even in the best of our works are deficient, as the Church and St. <hi>Paul</hi> confesses, <hi>Isa.</hi> 64.6. <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.6. <hi>&amp;</hi> 21. But this Inability is not from the Nature of the Law, but the voluntary corruption of Man. And so we are to understand the ancient Fathers when they say, and say truly, <hi>That God doth not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire things impossible;</hi> since elsewhere they affirm, <hi>That the highest perfection of a Christian in this life, is to see his own Imperfection;</hi> Not an unsinning Obedience, but an Obedience sincere, all the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection here attainable being when the Will habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually entertains nothing that is contrary to the Will of God. So that the good works of the best Men while they are Travellers here, are im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect; the state of Glory shall be their state of Perfection. Nor is this contrary to those Texts, wherein the Saints are said <hi>to walk perfectly, and not to turn to the right hand or the left; that</hi> David <hi>was a Man after God's own heart: Be ye perfect as your Father in Heaven is perfect,</hi> &amp;c. For in those pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces is not to be understood so much an absolute perfection, as the hearty desire and endeavors after it; a sincerity and integrity whereby the Faithful (thÃ´ the Scripture elsewhere speaks of their sins and Failings) do yet in the whole bent of their Lives study to serve God in the simplicity of their hearts without hypocrisie. And yet even this their imperfection is cover'd with Christ's per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection,
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:208153:101"/>in which respect the Church is said to be without spot or wrinkle; wherefore if no man be able exactly to fulfil the Law of God, much less is he able to supererogate, or do more that can be acceptable to God above or beyond his Law; besides, to beg daily for pardon of our sins (which our Saviour has enjoin'd us to do) and yet to boast of such works, are things inconsistent.</p>

                     <hi>Mat.</hi> 19.12. <hi>There be Eunuchs which have made themselves Eunuchs for the Kingdom of God. He that is able to receive it, let him receive it.</hi> Is not here a counsel to a single Life beyond a Command? So in the 21st <hi>Verse, If thou wilt be perfect, sell all that thou hast, and give it to the poor.</hi> Is not here a <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel</hi> to voluntary Poverty?</p>
                  <div type="answer">
                     <head>Answer.</head>
                     <p>Divine <hi>Counsels</hi> are <hi>Commands,</hi> and cannot be despised without sin and punishment, <hi>Psal.</hi> 107.11. <hi>Prov.</hi> 1.25. <hi>Luke</hi> 7.30. And accordingly these Texts are to be understood; they are Commands, thÃ´ particular, and given only to certain persons according to the exigency of their condition and gifts. In the first Text, single Life is not only counselled, but commanded on two conditionsâ<hi>If the Kingdom of Heaven doth so require it; and if one be assured of the Gift of Continency.</hi> Now every Man is bound to avoid all hindrances in his passage to Heaven, according to that of Christ, <hi>If thy right Eye offend thee, pluck it out,</hi> &amp;c. So he
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:208153:101"/>that hath the Gift of Continency, and knows that Marriage would hinder him, must make himself an Eunuch, not literally, (as <hi>Origen</hi> is said to have mistaken it) but live (as an Eunuch) unmar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried: And this not by way of counsel only, but as a Duty to further his own salvation. After the same manner, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. single Life in a large Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course is enjoin'd to them that have the Gift of Continency, not simply, but because it was expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient in those times of difficulty and persecution. Neither is the 2d Text a Counsel, but a Command given to the Young Man, who had answer'd more arrogantly than truly, and given false Testimony of himself, <hi>That he had kept all the Commandments from his Youth-up,</hi> when yet he was apparently co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetous, <hi>Mark</hi> 10.22. To suppress which excess of Pride, and to try and manifest his Folly, our Lord thus speaks to him; Not to set forth any new Doctrin, or way to perfection not contained in the Law.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. But thÃ´ we are not to expect Justification by the Law, or our own Righteousness, yet (I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peat it again, for it can never be too often, or too much inculcated) we are bound, as ever we hope for salvation, to practise and press after Holiness, Righteousness, and all good Works: Therefore when the Apostle argueth vehemently against Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification by the Works of the Law, yet he doth press the Duties of the Law â <hi>Do we then make void the Law through Faith? God forbid; yea, we establish the Law, Rom.</hi> 3.21. The Law continueth as our Rule, thÃ´ not as a Covenant;
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:208153:102"/>thÃ´ not appointed to justifie, yet commanded as the way we should walk in; because God's Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der is to communicate the benefits of Christ's Righteousness to none but such as shall by Faith receive him, and walk obediently to his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands. He has freely and graciously promised Rewards far beyond our best Works, and Pardon and Remission for our Defects and Transgressions, but the same are not to be bestowed on those who either stand idle, or employ themselves in Evil, but on the Labourers in his Vineyard, who pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke themselves and others to good Works, and from time to time bewail their Sins and Failings, striving continually for a Mastery over all their Corruptions. How strong and pathetical is that exhortative Command of the Apostle, <hi>Philip.</hi> 4.8. <hi>Finally, my Brethren, whatsoever things are true, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever things are honest, whatsoever things are just, whatsoever things are pure, whatsoever things are lovely, whatsoever things are of good report: if there be any vertue, and if there be any praise, think on these things.</hi> A Text, which as it singly comprehends more than all the Volumes of the Philosophers Morals, so if it were but sufficiently regarded by Christians, we should soon perceive an higher im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement in their Lives, Dealings, and Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sations! However, 'tis a grand and most unjust Calumny, That the Protestant Doctrin condemns or neglects good Works; For none do more vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorously urge the necessity of an holy Life, and that too upon solid Scripture grounds, whereby alone the same is attainable. And whatsoever the
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:208153:102"/>Church of <hi>Rome</hi> may boast in this matter, one main Reason why we reject several of her Doctrins (as <hi>Purgatory, Indulgences, Perfunctory Confessions, Penances and Absolutions,</hi> &amp;c.) is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they tend to loosness of Life, and not to that serious Mortification and real Godliness which the Christian Religion in its purity requires.</p>
                     <p n="2">II. The Rule of good Works, or that where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by we are to square all our Affections, Thoughts, Words, and Actions, is the Moral Law of God, briefly comprized in the <hi>Decalogue,</hi> that is, the TEN WORDS or COMMANDMENTS deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered to <hi>Moses;</hi> and more fully expounded in the Books of the Prophets, Apostles, and other inspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red Penmen of the Holy Scriptures.</p>
                     <p>These Commandments were written in Tables of Stone, (<hi>Deut.</hi> 10.4.) partly to signifie the perpetual obligation and continuance of the use of them to the end of the world; partly to shew the stony hardness of our hearts in which this Law was to be written, and to declare how hard it is to bring us to the obedience of them. And they were so written by the Finger of God, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause none but he can write his Law in our hearts.</p>
                     <p n="3">III. The general Rules to be observed for the understanding and right interpreting of this Law, are these:</p>
                     <p n="1">1. That the Law is spiritual, reaching to the Soul, and all the powers thereof, and binding the
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:208153:103"/>Heart, Thoughts and Conscience, as well as the outward Man, to entire and perfect Obedienceâ<hi>The Law is spiritual,</hi> Rom. 7.14. <hi>He that looketh on a Woman to lust after her, hath committed Adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery,</hi> Mat. 5.28. <hi>Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Mat.</hi> 22.37.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. That whereas the Precepts are all deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd with great brevity, there is in each of them to be understood a <hi>Syncedoche,</hi> or borrowed speech including more than is nakedly express'd: For 1. Whatsoever the Law commandeth, it forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth the contrary: And whatsoever it prohibits, the contrary Duty is enjoin'd. 2. What it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands or forbids in one kind, it commandeth or forbiddeth all of the same kind, and all the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees thereof, as likewise the Causes, Occasions, and all Provocations and Furtherances thereunto, each of which bear the name of that Sin, which by name is prohibited; so Christ calls a lascivious look <hi>Adultery,</hi> Mat. 5.28. And St. <hi>John</hi> affirms, <hi>He that hateth his Brother is a Murtherer,</hi> 1 John 3.5.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Of the Ten Commandments some are set down <hi>affirmatively,</hi> telling what we should do; others <hi>negatively,</hi> telling us what we should not do. And these <hi>last</hi> are more in number than the former (for they are only the 4th and 5th) both to put us in mind of our corruption, which need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth greatly to be restrained, and that we must abandon Sin before we can do any good work; as also because the <hi>Negative</hi> bindeth more strongly.
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:208153:103"/>For the Negative Precept obligeth <hi>always</hi> and <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessantly,</hi> or to all moments of time; the Affirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive <hi>always,</hi> but not <hi>incessantly,</hi> or to all moments, as for Example, we are always bound to do our Neighbour good, but not incessantly; for there are not continual occasions to do him good; but on the contrary it is never lawful to hurt our Neighbour.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. All the Commandments run in the Second Person of the Singular Number, <hi>Thou shalt, or Thou shalt not,</hi> &amp;c. Not You, or no Man, or every Man, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Because God being no Respecter of Persons, speaketh to all Men alike, as well the Rich as the Poor, High as Low; as likewise because no Man should put off the Commandments of God from himself, as thÃ´ they did not concern him; it being a common Abuse to esteem that which is generally spoken, as if it were spoken to none. Thus we find it frequent for Men to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess that God is just, and that he commandeth this, and forbiddeth that, and yet they usually so behave themselves, and shift off the matter to the general, as if it did nothing belong to them in particular, and they might notwithstanding live as they list: whereas every Soul ought to apply the Commands to himself, as much as if God had spoken to him by Name, and is accordingly to be affected therewith. Furthermore, all these Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts are propounded in the Future Tense, <hi>Thou shalt not,</hi> &amp;c. Because it is not enough if we had kept the Commandments of God heretofore, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:208153:104"/>we continue in the sincere performance of them to the end of our Lives.</p>
                     <p n="4">IV. The Commandments are divided into two Tables; the first Table, comprehending the Four first Precepts, contains our Duty to God. The second Table, in the other six, comprizes our Duty to Man.</p>
                     <p>The Sum of the first Table is, <hi>Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy Soul, and with all thy strength,</hi> Deut. 6.5. Mat. 22.37. Luke 10.27. The Sum of the second Table, <hi>Thou shalt love thy Neighbour as thy self,</hi> Lev. 19.18. Mat. 22.39. So that Charity, or the love of God and our Neighbour, is the Sum total of the whole Law.</p>
                     <p>The love of God is the ground of our love to our Neighbour; and our love to our Neighbour a testimony of our love to God, 1 <hi>John</hi> 4.20. <hi>Rom.</hi> 13.8. Hence the second Table is said to be like unto the first, <hi>Mat.</hi> 22.39. Because they go so hand in hand together, that no Man can perform the one, unless he accomplish the other.</p>

                           <p>This Commandment is part of the <hi>Moral Law,</hi> and cannot be Ceremonial, or binding to the <hi>Jews</hi> only, because the reason of it is immutable, and the same is so far from being repealed, that it is ratified in the Gospel, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.23.25. 2dly. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Image, Picture, or Statue made for Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Worship is <hi>an Idol,</hi> whether it be of false gods, or pretending to represent the True God, as appears by the Exposition of this Command given by <hi>Moses</hi> himself, for thus he saith, <hi>Deut.</hi> 4.12. <hi>The Lord spake unto you, ye heard the voice, but saw no similitude, only heard the voice; Take therefore good heed (for ye saw no manner of simili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude) lest ye corrupt your selves, and make you a gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven Image, the similitude of any Figure,</hi> &amp;c. Whence 'tis evident, That the Second Commandment forbids the Worshipping the True God by Images; for <hi>Moses</hi>'s Argument is, That God did therefore forbear to shew himself in any visible shape at the delivery of the Law, to the end they should make no Image of him, and that it might be better known that the Worshipping of Images, not only as they have reference to the Creatures or false Gods, but also as (in the intention of the Makers) they might have relation to himself, did come within the compass of Idolatry.</p>
                           <p n="3">3dly. The Scripture in sundry places attests, That those who erect Images to God, and in and by them think to Worship God, are guilty of horrible Idolatry. Thus the <hi>Israelites</hi> by making
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:208153:108"/>a Golden Calf committed Idolatry; they could not be so silly as to think that the Calf which they made was the God that brought them out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> but because the <hi>Egyptians</hi> worshipped their false Gods by an Hieroglyphick representation in the shape of an <hi>Ox,</hi> they would worship <hi>Jehovah</hi> in like manner, as appears by the very words of the Text, <hi>Exod.</hi> 32.5. <hi>Aaron after he had made a Golden Calf, built an Altar before it, and made Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation and said, To morrow is a Feast to the Lord</hi> (Jehovah.) So <hi>Micah</hi> made his Image in Honour of <hi>Jehovah,</hi> Judges 17.3. <hi>I had wholly dedicated the Silver unto the Lord</hi> (Jehovah;) and <hi>Verse</hi> 13. <hi>Now I know that the Lord</hi> (Jehovah) <hi>will do me good because I have a Levite to my Priest.</hi> Nay <hi>Jeroboam</hi>'s Calves were made to represent not false Gods, but <hi>Jehovah;</hi> for so we read, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 12.18. <hi>Behold thy Gods, O Israel! which brought thee up out of the Land of</hi> Egypt. But so far is the Almighty and Jealous God from accepting such Worship, that he declares in his Word, <hi>That such Worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers of him by Images, committed Idolatry, and were indeed Worshippers of the Devil. They provoked him to Jealousie with strange Gods, they Sacrificed unto Devils</hi> Deut. 32.17. <hi>They made a Calf in those days, and Sacrificed to the Idol,</hi> Acts, 7 41. Where the Gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den Calf is called an Idol, and the <hi>Israelites</hi> are said to Sacrifice to the Devil; which cannot be understood of the Judgment and Intention of the Men Worshipping it, as if they did design to Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship the Devil and false Gods thereby, but of the truth of the thing, and of the Judgment of God
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:208153:108"/>testifying that such Worship being contrary to his Command, did displease him, and had the Devil for its Author, and so, whatever they intended, was indeed the Worshipping of Devils and false Gods.</p>

                        <p>We know (<hi>saith St.</hi> Paul, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.4.) that an Idol is nothing in the world; <hi>whence it should seem, that Images are of things really existent, but Idols of things not existent,</hi> viz. <hi>such as never had any being in the world; and consequently that the Pictures of God, Christ, the Virgin</hi> Mary, <hi>Saints,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>though Religiously made, kept, or adored, cannot be Idols.</hi>

                           <p>St. <hi>Paul</hi> speaks not so much with reference to the Object which it represents, as in respect of the Vertue and Efficacy of Idols, which indeed is nothing. 2dly. We know that the Heathens had Idols not only of things feigned, but also of some things that were or had been truly existent; If any Emperor should require his own Statue, or that of his Father or Predecessor to be reverenc'd with di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Honours (which is thought to be at least one of the original causes of this mode of false Worship) will any Christian say, That complying herewith is not Idolatry, because such Images were Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentations of a real Person? 3dly. The Images of God, the Blessed Trinity, Christ, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are Lies; For God's Glorious and Incomprehensible Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture cannot be represented to Men by any Image,
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:208153:109"/>but in a way of infinite disparagement to him; nor Christ, for he is both God and Man; to paint his Divinity is both unlawful and infinitely more difficult than that of the Poet, <hi>Pinge sonum,</hi> Paint a voice; and if they mean it only of his Body, from whence should they have the true Copy, there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no Images or Pictures thereof talkt of till fome hundreds of Years after his Death and Ascension; and those Pictures they now have and Adore, are not alike in shape, lineaments, or colour. And as for the Saints (not to mention that there are Images abroad of such as never were, as St. <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stopher,</hi> &amp;c) it is an affront and unbecoming those Glorified Spirits to represent them in dull and senseless Images, much more to pay such Honours to them as they cannot but disclaim and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn.</p>

                           <p>That we ought not to make any Image of God is proved before; And as to the comparison, if a King forbid any Picture of himself to be made or set up, and any over officious Subject should not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding set up the King's Picture pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to do it in respect to the King; such Prince
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:208153:109"/>would undoubtedly esteem himself not Honour'd but highly Dishonour'd thereby, since his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands are broken, his Authority violated and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spised. Again, if a King require such Reverence to be given to his Presence-Chamber, it is fit he should be obeyed, seeing it is only a Civil, not Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious Worship; but since God hath severely for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden any Religious Worship to be given to any Images or Pictures, there is good reason his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibition should be observ'd.

                     <p>So that hereby is forbidden every wrong offer'd to the glory of God, the doing of ought that may any way reproach the Lord, or cause him to be the less reverenc'd, all unholy use of his ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Name, and prophaning of his Titles, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties, Actions and Ordinances, either by word or deed. Particularly</p>

                        <pb n="211" facs="tcp:208153:111"/>1. Blasphemy, which is a speaking evil of God, and may also be committed by thinking any thing unworthy of him: For he, to whom the Secrets of all hearts are open, takes notice of that dishonour; we may also be guilty thereof in our actions, when we who profess to be the Servants of God live so wickedly, as to bring on him a dishonour whom we own to be our Master and Lord, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.24. <hi>Through you the Name of God is blasphemed amongst the Gentiles.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2. Unlawful Swearing: An Oath is the cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling the God of Truth to witness; which in it self being duly performed is lawful, being com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by God, <hi>Thou shalt fear the Lord thy God, and swear by his Name,</hi> Deut. 6.13. And accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly we read, that God himself and his Angels have sworn, <hi>Gen.</hi> 22.16. <hi>Rev.</hi> 10.6. But this is never to be used but in things weighty and law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful; and then it must be done, 1. <hi>In truth;</hi> affirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing nothing but what we know to be true, and verifying by deed what we so undertake, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as the Oath is either assertory, or promissory. 2. <hi>In judgment;</hi> that is, with a due consideration both of the nature and importance of an Oath, which is no less than the staking of our Souls, and calling Almighty God to witness and revenge it upon us, if we deal falsly. 3. <hi>In righteousness;</hi> which implies, 1. <hi>A due Form,</hi> such as God's Word allows, that is, it must be by God alone, not by Creature or Idol, because God only is the Searcher of hearts, and able to avenge secret Perjuries; and also because every Oath is joined with Invo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:208153:112"/>(express'd or implied) which belongs to God alone. 2. <hi>A right end,</hi> viz. for the confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of Truth, the decision of Strife, the glory of God, and peace amongst Men.</p>
                     <div type="section">
                        <head>Hence appears the horrid Evil</head>
                        <p n="1">1. Of Perjury, or swearing falsly, whereby a Man by calling the God of Truth to be a Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness to his Lye, circumvents and scandalizes his Neighbour, and does, as it were, with his lips seal his own damnation.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. Of vain light Oaths (as they are common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly called) in Conversation, thÃ´ indeed they are heavy sins in the sight of God, because against his command, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.34. derogatory to his Majesty, by interesting his Holy Name, and calling him to witness about Trifles; and leading to Perjury, for he that makes no Conscience of common Swearing, does often forswear himself. Besides, 'tis an impertinent Sin, no temptation of profit or pleasure in it, nothing but a lewd Custom and ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous Conceit that there is something of Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lantry or Ornament in it; but such Wretches do but glory in their shame, for there is nothing more dishonourable, or that renders them more loath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>som and contemptible both to God and Man, their repeated Oaths making them the less to be credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in any thing they say: <hi>For he that will Swear, will Lye,</hi> saith the Proverb, grounded on universal Experience. So that besides the Offence to God, and Scandal to Men, and the Injuries thereby done
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:208153:112"/>to a Man's own Soul, it is prejudicial to his Repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation and Fortunes even in this world, so that every one that has any regard either to Conscience or Interest, is bound to forsake this foolish, but destructive Vice.</p>
                     </div>
                     <div type="section">
                        <head>Remedies against the Wicked Custom of SWEARING.</head>
                        <p n="1">1. Consider of the great guilt and danger of this Sin, and that in the dreadful day of Judgment; it will be no good Plea to alledge, <hi>That it was the Mode, and all the Fashion;</hi> you must then come to <hi>account for every idle word,</hi> Matth. 12.36. much more then for every wicked profane Oath.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. Labour to have thy heart continually pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sess'd with the Awe and Reverence of God, and to that purpose meditate often on the greatness of his Power and Perfections, That he is a God terrible in his Judgments, fearful in his Praises, doing Wonders; what infinite Love he hath shewn to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards thee in sending his only beloved Son to dye for thee whil'st thou wer't in a state of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity and Rebellion; such thoughts will certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly banish from thy mouth that contrary custom of prophaning the Divine Majesty.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. Accustom thy self to exact truth in all thou speakest, so shalt thou have no need to confirm it with an Oath; and watch over thy self, <hi>That thou offend not with thy Tongue;</hi> refrain all occasions that may betray thee to this Vice, as <hi>Drink, Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, Ill Company, Gaming,</hi> or the like: For he that
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:208153:113"/>would avoid the <hi>End,</hi> must avoid the Means and Temptations</p>
                        <p n="4">4. ThÃ´ ill Habits long continued are not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out great difficulty removed, yet 'tis utterly false and vain for any man to pretend he cannot for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear this Sin. If he were certain to be sent to the Gallies, or broken on the Wheel for the <hi>next Oath</hi> he swore, you should see how circumspect he would be, strugling with vitious Custom; and is not Hell and Damnation as terrible? And is it not the most certain thing in the world that these will be their portion, who continue in this Sin without Repentance, and forsaking of it? 'Twere well if those that were Rich, would oblige them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to give so much in Alms to the Poor for every Oath they swore, and the Poor to receive so many Stripes, and charge their Familiars faithfully to exact and impose this on them as often as they transgressed; I have known this course reclaim several inveterate Swearers.</p>
                        <p>Lastly, to all the endeavours must be added <hi>Prayer,</hi> that God will enable thee to overcome this wicked Custom; and if thou settest thy self sincerely to the work, doubt not of his assistance to vanquish it.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. A third Breach of this Command is in <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecrations,</hi> when wickedly we curse our selves or others, especially that most horrid, thÃ´ too com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, Phrase of daring or challenging <hi>God to Damn them;</hi> a Speech undoubtedly first dictated by the <hi>Devil,</hi> and used by none but his Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.</p>
                        <p n="4">
                           <pb n="215" facs="tcp:208153:113"/>4. Other idle irreverent use of the Name of God, without due consideration of his treme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dous Majesty, as in our common talk crying out, <hi>O Lord! O God! O Jesu!</hi> Or by way of Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, <hi>Good God! Good Lord!</hi> &amp;c. in trifling matters, and of no moment. As also all abuse of Scripture Phrases to prophane <hi>Jesting,</hi> or in <hi>Hypocrisy</hi> to deceive.</p>

                     <head>The Fourth Commandment.</head>
                     <head type="sub">Remember the Sabbath day to keep it Holy. Six days shalt thou labour, and do all thy work: But the seventh day is the Sabbath of the Lord thy God: in it thou shalt not do any work, thou, nor thy Son, nor thy Daughter, thy Man-servant, nor thy Maid-servant, nor thy Cattel, nor thy Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger that is within thy Gates. For in six days the Lord made Heaven and Earth, the Sea, and all that in them is, and rested the seventh day: wherefore the Lord blessed the Sabbath day, and hallowed it.</head>
                     <p>This Command requires of every Man one day of seven in every week to be set apart unto an holy Rest, and enjoins all persons to separate themselves from their ordinary labours and cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings concerning this life on the same, and to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend wholly to the worship of God alone: For thÃ´ we ought to serve God in our lawful Callings all the other six days, yet on this day we are es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially and wholly to regard the same, so as to keep it holy to the Lord both publickly and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vately
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:208153:114"/>in the practice of the Duties of Necessity, Piety, and Mercy.</p>
                     <p>In this Precept there are two parts, the Precept itself, and the Confirmation thereof. The Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept is, That we <hi>sanctifie the Sabbath,</hi> which is illustrated,</p>
                     <p>First, By an admonitory Particle, <hi>Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,</hi> &amp;c. either for that the <hi>Israelites</hi> had before been warned to sanctify it, by reason of their oppressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in <hi>Egypt,</hi> and had discontinued and neglected it; or to signifie, that althÃ´ all the Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments ought diligently to be remembred, yet this more especially, as having the least sight of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to direct us to the observance of it, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause we are naturally apt to be most negligent in it.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, By declaring the Precept in opposing by an <hi>Antithesis</hi> the works which were to be done the six days, to those that should not be done the 7th day.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, By a distribution of the Subjects, Men or Beasts, the Men either Natives or Strangers, and both those either Superiors or Inferiors, all must enjoy and observe this Rest. The Confirmation is grounded on God's Example: <hi>For in six days,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>In this Precept of sanctifying the Sabbath, we distinguish between that which is Ethical or Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, and that which is Typical or Ceremonial; it was Ceremonial as far as concern'd the sanctifying of the 7th day precisely, by that means to separate <hi>Jews</hi> from <hi>Gentiles;</hi> but Moral, in that one day of
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:208153:114"/>seven must be sanctified for God's Service: For thÃ´ from the beginning of the world till Christ's Resurrection the last day of the week, commonly called, <hi>The Seventh Day,</hi> or <hi>Saturday,</hi> was the day appointed thereunto, and which the People of God constantly observ'd in memory of the Creation, because God then ceased from all his works, and blessed and sanctified it, <hi>Gen.</hi> 2.2. But as God rested from his labour on the last day of the week, so the Resurrection of the blessed Jesus (whereon he ceased from all his labour and afflictions) being on the first day of the week, the Christian Church hath sanctified, or set apart the first Day for Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Worship: For as the one was specially san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified in regard of the Creation of the world, so the other in respect of the Restauration and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption of the world, which is a greater work than the Creation; the Reasons of this change are:</p>
                     <p n="1">1. To be a thankful Memorial of Christ's Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Nor does it seem to want Divine Institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, because as Christ on that day arose, so he also on that day appeared to his Disciples, <hi>John</hi> 20.19. And again another time, <hi>ver.</hi> 26. Accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly the Apostles met on the first day, <hi>Acts</hi> 20.7. And it appears to have been generally their day of assembling for Religious Exercises, <hi>Acts</hi> 16.2. And therefore it is called <hi>the Lord's-Day, Rev.</hi> 1.10. which could be only in regard of the special Dedication of it to the Lord's Service, for
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:208153:115"/>otherwise all days are the Lords, and he is to be Served and Worshipped in them. The general Sins here forbidden are all neglecting of the Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of that day, as of Prayer, Meditation, Thanks<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving, Examination of our Hearts, at least for the Week past, how God hath dealt with us in Benefits and Chastisements, and how we have dealt with him in keeping or breaking his Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, that by both we may find matter to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort and humble us, to move us to Thankfulness for Mercies received, and earnest Prayer for par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don of our Trespasses, and supply of all Necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries; In fine, all kind of prophaning that Holy Day by needless Works, Words, or Thoughts, about our Callings or Recreations, are here pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited; As on the contrary, there is required private Prayer, resorting to Church, reverent and attentive Behaviour there, joyning in the so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn Prayers and the Sacrament, when admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stred, taking heed to the Word Preached, Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with, and instructing our private Families, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Those that Religiously observe this Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment shall be Blessed, 1. Spiritually in all the Holy Exercises and Ordinances then perform'd, which shall contribute to their further encrease both in the Knowledge and Fear of God, and all other Heavenly Graces accompanying Salvation. 2dly. In matters of this Life, we shall not be hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred by keeping the Sabbath, but more encreased than if we did work that day. As on the other side, what seems to be got by entrenching on the
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:208153:115"/>Lord's Day, shall by the just Curse of God melt and vanish away, what shew soever it may have of Profit, and will bring some Curse or other up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on our Labours in the week days, which in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves are honest and lawful.</p>
                     <p>Thus much, tho very <hi>briefly,</hi> according to our method in this short Treatise (wherein we leave many things unmentioned, which each pious Soul conversant in God's Word may collect) touching the <hi>First Table,</hi> or our Duty towards God, the due observation whereof is call'd <hi>Piety.</hi> We now proceed to the Second Table prescribing our Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty one to another, which is called <hi>Justice</hi> or <hi>Right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eousness,</hi> laid down in the Six following Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments.</p>

                     <p>The general meaning and scope of this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, is, that the Quality of Mens Persons and Places in whatsoever Estate, Natural, Civil, or Ecclesiastiaal, and with whatsoever Relation to us, be duly acknowledged; requiring the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of all Duties that one Man oweth to another, either Superiors, Inferiors, or Equals; for as it enjoyns all due Carriage of Inferiours to their Superiors; and by consequence of Superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ors to their Inferiors; so likewise by analogy, of
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:208153:116"/>Equals amongst themselves; and all this under the sweet endearing Realtion of Parents and Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and Brethren of the same Family.</p>
                     <p>The Duties of Inferiors to their Superiors, are Reverence, Obedience, and Gratitude; of Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periors to their Inferiors, Benovelence, Justice, Diligence or Vigilancy; Of Equals between them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, that they Live Lovingly and Sociably, and affording due respect to each other.</p>

                     <p>The Duties of Subjects to Magistrates, are, 1.

We must be subject not only to good and godly Magistrates, but even if they should happen to be otherwise; for the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand is general, <hi>Submit to every Ordinance of Man;</hi> and accordingly we have Examples of the <hi>Isra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elites</hi> obeying <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> Exod. 3. and <hi>Daniel</hi>'s obeying <hi>Nebuchadnezzar, Dan.</hi> 2. Only they are not to be obeyed in things <hi>morally Evil,</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to God's Word; for so we are taught by the Example of the Midwives, <hi>Exod.</hi> 1. of <hi>Saul</hi>'s Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 22.17.

Lastly, it is our Duty to <hi>pray</hi> for them; <hi>I exhort therefore, that first of all, Supplications, Prayers, Intercessions, and giving of Thanks be made for all Men: For Kings, and for all that are in Authority, that we may lead a quiet and peaceable life in all godliness and honesty,</hi> 1 Tim. 2.1, &amp; 2.</p>

<pb n="223" facs="tcp:208153:117"/>to and between all their Subjects with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out partiality, delay or corruption.</p>
                     <p>The Duty of Christian People towards their Ecclesiastical Superiors or Ministers of the Gospel, are,</p>
                     <p n="1">1. To pay them a singular love and regardâ<hi>We beseech you, Brethren, to know them which labour amongst you, and are over you in the Lord, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monish you; And to esteem them very highly for their works sake,</hi> 1 Thess. 5.12. <hi>Let the Elders that rule well be counted worthy of double honour, especially those that labour in the word and doctrin,</hi> 1 Tim. 5.17.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. To receive and obey their Doctrin agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to God's Word with gladness of heartâ<hi>Remember them that are set over you, who have spoken unto you the Word of God, whose Faith follow, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering the end of their Conversation. Obey them, and submit your selves, for they watch for your souls,</hi> Hebr. 13.7. &amp; 17. <hi>We thank without ceasing, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause when ye received the Word of God which ye heard of us, ye received it not as the word of men, but as it is in truth the Word of God,</hi> 1 Thess. 2.13.</p>

                     <p>Lastly, To pray for them; so saith St. <hi>Paul, Eph.</hi> 6.17, 19. having commanded them to <hi>pray for all Saints,</hi> addsâ<hi>And for me, that utterance may be

                     <p n="2">2. To reprove ill Livers, reclaim in the spirit of meekness such as Err; resist Gainsayers, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort the Afflicted, and strengthen the Weak.</p>

                     <p>The common Duties reciprocal between Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands and Wives, are conjugal Love, delight in each others Society, mutual help both in Sickness and Health, strict Loyalty and Fidelity to each other both in thoughts and actions; particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly,</p>
                     <p>The Wife is, first to be subject to her Husband in a gentle and moderate way, acknowledging and reverencing him as her Head. The Man is the Woman's Head, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.3. <hi>Wives submit your selves unto your own husbands, as unto the Lord. For the husband is the wives head, even as Christ is the head of the Church,</hi> Ephes. 5.22. This the Woman was sentenc'd unto for being first in the transgres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:208153:118"/>â<hi>Thy desire shall be subjected unto thine husband, and he shall rule over thee,</hi> Gen. 3.16.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. To obey him, <hi>Let the wife see that she reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence her husband,</hi> Ephes. 5.33. <hi>Likewise ye wives be in subjection to your own husbands,</hi> 1 Pet 3.1. <hi>Even as</hi> Sarah <hi>obeyed</hi> Abraham, <hi>calling him Lord, ver.</hi> 6.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. To be faithful to him both in a strict Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stity, avoiding not only the Fault, but also the sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pition of dishonesty or lightness, and in carefully and providently managing what he intrusts her with.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. She must be an helper to him, <hi>Gen.</hi> 2.18. to his Soul, by her godly Behaviour, and Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian humble modest Admonitions and Prayers; to his Mind, by endeavouring to mitigate his Cares, and sweeten his Troubles; to his Body; by her tender love and diligence; and to his Estate, by her Frugality, and discreet ordering of things in the Family.</p>
                     <p>On the other side, the Duties of the Husband to his Wife are,</p>
                     <p n="1">1. An entire love to herâ<hi>Husbands love your Wives, even as Christ also loved the Church. So ought Men to love their Wives as their own bodies: He that loveth his Wife, loveth himself. For no Man ever yet hated his own flesh, but nourisheth and che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risheth it,</hi> Ephes. 5.22, 29.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. To provide for and allow her (according to his condition and ability) what is meet and comely during his life, and also that she may be
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:208153:119"/>Provided for after his death, if it so fall out.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Faithfulness of the Bed is as well and as much required of him as of her; For thÃ´ custom has made it less scandalous in the Man, yet the Sin is equal before God, or rather greater in him than her, because he is the Head, and ought to set her a good Example.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. To dwell with her as one of knowledge; to govern, direct, and instruct her both in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Religion, and civil Prudence; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore St. <hi>Paul</hi> bids the Wives learn of their Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands at home, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.36. which must be done with all tenderness, sweetness, and affability. For,</p>
                     <p>Lastly, He is to <hi>give honour unto her as the weaker vessel,</hi> 1 Pet. 3.7. that is, to bear with her infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities; to defend and protect her; to make ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of her as of his Companion or Yokefel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, remembring, that when the Woman was first Form'd, she was not taken out of <hi>Adam</hi>'s Head, because she was not to Rule over him; nor out of his Feet, because she was not intended as his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant or Vassal, but out of his Side to the end that Man should take her as his Mate; and therefore the Husband is to suffer himself sometimes to be admonished, or advised by her; it was God's Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment to <hi>Abraham</hi> concerning <hi>Sarah</hi> his Wife <hi>What</hi> Sarah <hi>shall say unto thee, hear her voice,</hi> Gen. 21.12. Thus <hi>Elkanah</hi> was willing to subscribe unto his Wife <hi>Hannah</hi>'s counsel for her tarrying at home till the Child was weaned, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 1.23.
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:208153:119"/>
                        <hi>And</hi> Elkanah <hi>her husband said unto her, Do what seemeth thee best, tarry till thou hast weaned him; only the Lord accomplish his word.</hi> This respect of Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands to their Wives, was taken notice of even by the Heathen, for <hi>Aristotle</hi> in the 8th Book of his <hi>Ethics</hi> tells us, <hi>That the Master of a Family exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth (after a sort) a Power Tyrannical over his Servants; a Power Regal over his Children, because Kings are Fathers of their Common-weals; but in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of his Wife, he exerciseth a Power Aristocrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal, not after his own Will, but agreeable to the Honour and Dignity of the married Estate.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>We proceed now to the Duties of Children to their Parents, which are,</p>
                     <p n="1">1. To reverence and obey themâ<hi>Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren obey your Parents in the Lord, for this is right, Ephes.</hi> 6.1. For which we have the Example of our blessed Lord, who, thÃ´ the Eternal Son of God, and Lord of all, submitted himself to his earthly Parents, <hi>viz.</hi> his Mother the blessed Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin, and <hi>Joseph</hi> his supposed Fatherâ<hi>He went down with them, and came to</hi> Nazareth, <hi>and was sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to them,</hi> Luke 2.51. And this respect is to be paid not only to our natural Parents, but also to Stepfathers and Mothers; For so <hi>Moses</hi>'s Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther-in-law says unto himâ<hi>Hear now my voice, I will give thee counsel, and God shall be with thee, Exod.</hi> 18.19. And <hi>Ruth</hi> unto <hi>Naomi</hi> her Mother<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in lawâ<hi>All that thou biddest me, I will do,</hi> Ruth 3.5.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. <hi>We</hi> are so far to reverence our Parents, as
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:208153:120"/>that althÃ´ we are not to follow them in evil, yet we are not therefore to contemn them, or think our selves disobliged from our Devoir, but rather to make it our business to cover and conceal even their real Crimes, <hi>Gen.</hi> 9.23. much less are we tÃ´ disregard or disown them for their Poverty, or In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities of Ageâ<hi>Hearken to thy Father that begat thee, and despise not thy Mother when she is old,</hi> Prov. 24.22. <hi>For the Eye that mocketh his Father, and despiseth to obey his Mother, the Ravens of the vallies shall pick it out, and the young Eagles shall eat it,</hi> Prov. 30.17.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. This observance of Children towards their Parents is especially manifested in their Marriage, that it be not entred into without their consent: For as the Parent is the principal Disposer of the Child; so althÃ´ his Authority be not so great, as that the Child is to be forced and compelled by him; yet the reverent and dutiful respect which the Child ought to bear thereunto, should be a strong inducement not to dissent or renounce that Advice, without great and weighty cause; and the Child is bound to endeavor by all manner of dutiful Carriage to over come, or at least mitigate the Parents severity in that behalf.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. 'Tis the Duty of Children to aid and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve their Parents, to assist and minister to them in all their wants of what kind soeverâ<hi>Let Children and Nephews learn first to shew prety at home, and to requite their Parents: for that is good and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable before God,</hi> 1 Tim. 5.4. The necessity of the performance of these Duties is so great, that
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:208153:120"/>if any Child neglecteth them, and doth the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary by ill usage of Parents, either in word or deed, he or she is worthy of Death, even by <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses</hi>'s Law, <hi>Exod.</hi> 21.15. <hi>He that smiteth his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther or his Mother, shall die the Death.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Offices of Parents to their Children, are, 1. To Instruct them in Religion, as they are able to receive it. <hi>Ye Fathers bring up your Children in the nurture and admonition of the Lord,</hi> Ephes. 6.4. 2dly. To observe the Capacities and Inclinations of their Children, and as far as their own Abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty will reach, to apply them accordingly, in due time, to some good honest Calling, that so being Train'd up to Industry, and in such a Trade as they are fittest for, they may not afterwards live idly, or be without means of a comfortable sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance. 3. In Educating their Children, they are first to encourage them, by making them in Love with their Duty by Rewards and Commendati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons when they do well; not to be always harsh and severe towards them, but to take St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Advice, when he bids <hi>Parents not to provoke their Children to Wrath,</hi> Col. 3.21. That is, not to discourage or give them occasion of thinking hardly of their Parents as they will be apt to do, if they see they cannever please them. But if Children cannot be won to Vertue and Industry by this mild, gentle Method, then the Parents are not to fail of Correcting them, which ought to be <hi>se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere,</hi> that they may fear it, <hi>not too often,</hi> or for <hi>slight faults,</hi> for that will harden them; and to be inflicted not in <hi>Passion</hi> or any indecent Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage,
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:208153:121"/>but such a Gravity as they may see it is contrary to your own Inclinations, and wholly for their Good. <hi>He that spareth the Rod, hateth his Son,</hi> saith <hi>Solomon,</hi> Prov. 13.24. Thousands of Children are daily ruined for want of due Chastise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in their Youth. 4ly. Parents are to seek out and provide for their Children suitable Marriages in time convenient. 5ly. In all things to give them good Examples, to Pray for, and Bless them. <hi>Lastly,</hi> not only to maintain them in their youth, but as far as lawfully they can, by Industry and Frugality, to provide that they may live honestly afterwards, distributing their Goods amongst them, what they can spare in their Life-time, and the rest at their Death.</p>
                     <p>The Duties of Servants to their Masters, are 1. To obey all their lawful Commands. <hi>Servants in all things obey your Masters,</hi> Ephes. 6.6. And this must be done freely and chearfully, with good will, doing Service, <hi>verse</hi> 7. 2dly. To be Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, that is, neither carelesly wasting, nor fraudu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently embezilling or purloyning their Masters Goods. 3dly. To be diligent, dispatching the Duties of their Employment, without sloth or idleness, or spending time unprofitably; and this not only when their Masters Eye is over them, or they think he may perceive and punish them, but even where he can never discover it; for tho' he do not, God doth see and will avenge such wilful breach of Duty to your Masters; therefore the Apostle requires Obedience from Servants in sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gleness of Heart, <hi>not with eye-service, as men-plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sers,
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:208153:121"/>but as the Servants of Christ, doing the will of God from the heart,</hi> Eph. 6.5, 6. 4ly. To bear patiently and meekly the Reproofs and Correcti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons inflicted by their Masters, <hi>Not answering again,</hi> Tit. 2.9. For surely rude replies do justly encrease their Masters displeasure and their own fault; whereas when they are justly reprehended, they should be thankful for it, and resolve to amend and never offend in the like kind; nay, tho' they are rebuked or corrected where they are in no fault, they are not clamorously or prerem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptorily to defend or justifie themselves, but take it patiently, as a just Punishment for their other Sins. This is St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s Rule, <hi>Servants be subject to your Masters, with all fear, not only to the good and gentle, but also to the froward: For this is thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy, if a man for Conscience towards God endure Grief, suffering wrongfully: For what Glory is it, if when ye be buffeted for your faults, ye shall take it pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiently? But if when you do well and suffer for it, ye take it patiently, this is acceptable with God,</hi> 1 Pet. 2.20.</p>
                     <p>The Duties of Masters are, 1. To have a care to instruct and Catechise their Servants, and to teach them the Fear of the Lord, 2. To be just in performing those conditions on which they were hired, to afford them sufficient Food and Ray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment suitable to their Condition, and not to with-hold or diminish their Wages, for then he becomes an Oppressor. 3. Not to impose too hard or excessive Labours upon them, but to use them with Kindness and Bounty, and with that mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration and good Example, as may shew he forgets
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:208153:122"/>not <hi>That he himself also hath a Master in Heaven,</hi> Eph. 6.9. <hi>Lastly,</hi> To <hi>Pray</hi> with and for them; and plentifully to recompence their Service when they part from them, according as the Lord hath Blessed them by their Labour; or when they have spent their Youth and Strength in our Service, not to turn them off, but provide a Competency to maintain them in their Age. <hi>When thou sendest him out free from thee, thou shalt not let him go away empty,</hi> Deut. 15.13. <hi>Thou shalt not oppress an hired Servant that is poor and needy, whether he be of thy Brethren, or of the Strangers that are in thy Land within thy Gates. At his day thou shalt give him his Hire, neither shall the Sun go down upon it, for he is poor, and setteth his Heart upon it; lest he cry against thee unto the Lord, and it be sin unto thee,</hi> Deut. 24.14. I have insisted the longer on these relative Duties, because of the frequent failings which we may observe therein, and the grand Evils and Confusions that ensue thereupon.</p>

                     <head>The Sixth Commandment. <hi>Thon shalt not Kill.</hi>
                     </head>
                     <p>The general effect of this Precept is, That the Life and Person of Man (as bearing the Image of God) be not invaded, but preserved; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that we are not to hurt our own Persons, or the Person of our Neighbour, but to procure, as much as in us lies, the safety thereof; so that here is forbidden all kind of Evil tending to the
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:208153:122"/>impeachment of the safety and health of Man's Person, with every hurt done, threatned, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to the Soul or Body either of our selves or our Neighbours.</p>
                     <p>In particular, all Murders, making away of our selves, or impairing our own or others health by Intemperance, as Gluttony, Drunkenness, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> So likewise all Duels, Manslaughter, Wounding or Maiming of others, Hatred, Malice, Calumny, Detraction, taking away or diminishing any Man's good Name: Anger, unjust Wrath, <hi>&amp;c. He that sheddeth man's Blood, by man shall his Blood be shed, because God made man in his own Image,</hi> Gen. 9.6. <hi>Bloody and deceitful men shall not live out half their days,</hi> Psal. 55.23. <hi>Whosoever hateth his brother, is a murtherer,</hi> 1 John 3.15. <hi>Whosoever shall say to his brother</hi> Racha, <hi>shall be in danger of the Council, but whoever shall say, Thou fool, he shall be in danger of Hell-fire,</hi> Mat. 5.22. <hi>Be not hasty in thy spirit, to be angry,</hi> saith <hi>Solomon,</hi> Eccles. 7.9. And, <hi>Thou shalt not avenge, or bear a grudge,</hi> saith God by <hi>Moses,</hi> Lev. 19.18.</p>
                     <p>But this Law does not prohibit, but establish the execution of vindicative Justice by the Magistrate, who is to be a Terror to Evil Doers, by curbing Offences with fit Punishments, that one may ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther perish than the Community, and others by that Example be deterr'd from Wickedness. To which is opposite too much lenity, such as <hi>Eli</hi> the High Priest was guilty of, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 2. which begets and encreases a greater liberty in sinning. And not only it is a Sin to kill, but also not to kill,
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:208153:123"/>when the Law of God requires it, as appears in the case of <hi>Saul,</hi> 1 Sam. 15.</p>
                     <p>Nor does this Command forbid a just War, but the same may lawfully be waged by Christians, as of old by the <hi>Jews,</hi> because the same is not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited in the New Testament, but on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary the Captain of the <hi>Capernaites,</hi> Matth. 8. and <hi>Cornelius</hi> the <hi>Centurion, Acts</hi> 10. are reckon'd amongst the Faithful; neither did <hi>John</hi> dehort the Soldiers from War-fare, but advised them to be content with their pay, and not to commit inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice, <hi>Luke</hi> 3. Now that War is just, which is necessary, on a just cause, and warranted by the Supream Magistrate, and not managed by private Authority.</p>
                     <p>But because most of the violations of this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand proceed from Passion and inordinate Wrath, it will be necessary to fortifie our Souls with</p>
                     <div type="considerations">
                        <head>Certain Considerations tending to the prevention or restraining our <hi>ANGER.</hi>
                        </head>
                        <p n="1">1. The First Rule in this Case is, That as soon as ever we perceive our Blood boil, and that we are moved, we must endeavour to repress and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate our resentment; and if we cannot altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther appease the Emotion within, yet by all means guard thy Tongue from breaking forth into out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragious Speeches, for that Breath will but blow the Coals to a greater combustion both in thy self and thine Adversary; where as if thou confine and stifle the flame within, there is hope that it may
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:208153:123"/>quickly be quenched; especially if instead of raving at him that hath offended thee, thou betake thy self to Prayer, laying before God thine Infirmity, and beseeching him to guard thee in that temptation.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. Consider often the excellency, loveliness and benefits of Patience and Meekness, and on the contrary the deformity and mischiefs of <hi>Rage</hi> and <hi>Passion;</hi> how it distorts the Visage, captivates Reason, and during the Fit, renders a Man per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly <hi>mad</hi> and distracted; disinabling him either to speak Reason, or hear it, and exposing himself to all kind of disadvantages; whereas he that preserves his mind in a calm, sedate temper, sees how to remedy the Ill, and is fure to triumph over his Adversary in the thoughts of all judicious Men: For he that revenges an ill turn, is at most but <hi>even</hi> with him that did it; but he that <hi>neglects</hi> or forgives it, shews himself his Superior.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. Consider further the great Discommodities attending this passion; most true is our Proverb, <hi>An hasty Man never wants Wo;</hi> he deprives him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self of the Crown of Glory which is promised to the meek; he becomes the Slave and Instrument of the Devil; he kills his own Soul, to wound another's Body; he forfeits Wisdom, for his Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding is blinded; he loses <hi>Justice,</hi> for the <hi>wrath of man accomplisheth not the righteousness of God,</hi> James 1.20. He deprives himself of <hi>Friends,</hi> and the benefits of Societyâ<hi>Make no friendship with an angry man, and with a furious man thou shalt not go,</hi> Prov. 22.24. And, above all, he deprives himself of the splendor and illumina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:208153:124"/>of the Holy Ghost; for God hath promised that his Spirit shall rest on none but the <hi>humble and peaceable,</hi> Isa. 66.2.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. When we see the Excesses of others, we ought to remind our own Faults, and how often and grievously <hi>we our selves offend</hi>other men; that so the consideration of our own infirmities may render us apt to excuse the Failures of others; but especially by thinking how heinously and fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently we <hi>trespass against God,</hi> and that if he should have been so severe to mark all that we have done amiss, we had long since been cut off: let us therefore imitate his patience and long-suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering, who hath commanded us to pray <hi>to be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given our trespasses, as we forgive them that trespass against us.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="5">5. Especially we ought to set before us the Example of the Blessed Jesus, who endured all Reproaches and Torments for our sakes with a perfect patience; and <hi>when he was reviled, reviled not again,</hi> 1 Pet. 2.23. Now if he, the Lord of Glory-suffer'd thus unjustly, and yet <hi>so meekly</hi> from his own Creatures, with what Face can we com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain of petty Injuries done to us? Rather we ought to remember how great punishments our sins have <hi>deserved,</hi> and then, whether our Sufferings be from God or man, we must acknowledg them to be far less than what is due to us, and so cannot but be ashamed to be impatient at them. In fine, 'tis the Office of a Christian Man in this life, <hi>to do good, and suffer evil,</hi> and to persevere therein with patience and joy unto the end, in imitation of Jesus Christ his Head.</p>

This Consideration arm'd <hi>Joseph</hi> against the Temptations of his Mistriss, <hi>How can I do this great wickedness, and sin against God?</hi> Gen. 39.9. 3. Care to keep <hi>a good ConscienceâI find more
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:208153:125"/>bitter than death, the woman whose heart is snares and nets, and her hands as bands; he that is good before God shall escape from her, but the sinner shall be taken by her,</hi> Eccles. 7.26. 4. <hi>Temperance</hi> in Meats and Drinks, especially avoiding all Excess either in quantity or quality, and learn to mortifie and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due your Body with Fasting. 5. <hi>To shun all occasions,</hi> make a Covenant with our Eyes, <hi>Job</hi> 31.1. All o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Vices may be conquer'd by <hi>Combat</hi> and <hi>Resist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance,</hi> but <hi>Carnality</hi> is to be vanquisht only by flight; therefore St. <hi>Paul</hi> saith, <hi>Fly Fornication,</hi> 1 Cor. 6.18. Lastly, <hi>Fervent Prayer to God;</hi> for this <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean Devil</hi> is of that kind of which our Lord saith, They are not to be cast out, <hi>but by Fasting and Prayer,</hi> Mat. 17.21.</p>

                     <head>The Eighth Commandment. <hi>Thou shalt not Steal.</hi>
                     </head>
                     <p>Hereby is forbidden whatsoever is prejudicial to our own, or our Neighbor's Wealth, that we no way hinder, diminish or abuse the same; but that we give to every one that which is his, and do our best (as far as our Callings and Means will suffer) to preserve his Goods, and (as occasion serveth) help to encrease them by all lawful courses and honest dealingâ<hi>Let him that stole, steal to more; but rather let him labor, working with his hands the thing that is good, that he may have to give to him that needeth,</hi> Ephes. 4:28. <hi>Not purloining, but shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all good fidelity, that they may adorn the Doctrin of God our Saviour in all things,</hi> Tit. 2.10.</p>
                     <p>By this Commandment Property is establisht,
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:208153:125"/>and their Error confuted who hold Community of Goods: For whereas Theft is forbidden, it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily implies distinct possessions, or <hi>Meum &amp; Tuum;</hi> some things mine, and some things thine.</p>
                     <p>The occasion of this Precept was, that Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tousness, which naturally adheres unto us, whereby it comes to pass that we are not contented with our Estate and Means, but lust and long after o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther mens, and use of all our endeavours to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pass them, whether by right or wrong; from whence arise Frauds, Cheating, Injuries, Oppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions, Thefts and Robberies. All which are here prohibited, not only when committed directly, as when by open violence; or privately, without the Owner's consent, we take away another Man's Goods: But also when it is done indirectly, by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit in buying or selling, using false Weights or Measures, perverting of Justice, over-reaching one another in Contracts, taking unlawful Usury, running into Peoples Debt, when we know we are not able, or do not use our utmost Endeavors, or make Conscience to pay them, and the like.</p>
                     <p>In all such Cases if we have done any wrong, we must, to our utmost Ability, make Restitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion either to the Party or his Heirs, if known; or if unknown, by bestowing the value in charitable Uses to the Poor: For God strictly requires, that if any thing be unjustly gotten, either by Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, or by Fraud and Deceit, or any other ill way, <hi>Restitution</hi> be made to the true Owner, <hi>Lev.</hi> 6.2. <hi>Numb.</hi> 5.6. of which we have Examples <hi>before the Law</hi> in <hi>Jacob</hi> and his Sons, <hi>Gen.</hi> 43.12,
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:208153:126"/>and 21. <hi>under the Law</hi> by the profession of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muel,</hi> 1 Sam. 12.4. and the practice of <hi>Micah, Judges</hi> 17.2. who thÃ´ an Idolater, yet made Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science of it; and <hi>under the Gospel</hi> in <hi>Zacheus, Luke</hi> 19.8.</p>
                     <p>This <hi>Restitution</hi> is a Duty necessarily to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by all that hope for Salvation: For with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it we can neither have any true Faith to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade us, <hi>That our sin of Theft is remitted;</hi> nor any sincere Repentance: For God pardons no Sin which we will pertinaciously retain and live in, <hi>Prov.</hi> 28.13. But he that restoreth not ill-got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten Goods, liveth still in his Theft, and repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not of it, seeing Restitution is an inseparable Fruit of Repentance, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 33.15.</p>
                     <p>Now this Restitution ought to be of all the <hi>whole</hi> that is unjustly gotten, either by Force or Fraud; by Contract, or out of Contract; by Calumny, False Accusation, Lying, Oppression, or any other ill Course; if the Party be able; or at least so much to the utmost as he is able: yea, the Law of God required that to the principal, <hi>a fifth part</hi> should be added, <hi>Lev.</hi> 6.5. <hi>Num.</hi> 5.7. And even Equity itself requires, that besides the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal, so much more be added as the person is damnified by this unjust detention of his Goods.</p>
                     <p>Nor is this work to be put off unto the end of our Lives, or <hi>after our death;</hi> but as soon as ever we heartily repent, and desire Forgiveness, we must confess, bewail and forsake our Sin, that God may be reconciled unto us, and then we must make satisfaction to our wronged Neighbor; <hi>If thou
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:208153:126"/>bring thy Gift before the Altar, and there remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brest that thy Brother hath ought against thee, leave there thy Gift before the Altar, and go thy way; first be reconciled to thy Brother, and then come and offer thy Gift.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>There are Four Vertues must concur in the right use of our Goods. 1. <hi>Justice</hi> in getting them. 2. <hi>Parsimony</hi> or Thrift in keeping them, whereby we honestly preserve them that they be not vainly and unprofitably mispent. 3. <hi>Frugali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> in enjoying them; whereby we dispose of our Goods justly and honestly gotten, to fit and neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary Uses in a fober and moderate manner. 4. <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berality</hi> in communicating them.</p>
                     <p>To this last Vertue the Holy Scriptures invite us, 1. By positive <hi>Commands,</hi> enforced with most urgent <hi>Reasons,</hi> Luke 6.30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36. <hi>Give to every man that asketh of theeâAnd as ye would that men should do to you, de ye to them likewise. For if ye love them who love you, what thank have ye? for sinners also do even the same. And if you lend to them of whom you hope to receive, what thank have ye? for sinners also lend to sinners, to receive as much again. But love ye your Enemies, and do good, and lend hoping for nothing again, and your Reward shall be great, and ye shall be the Children of the most High: For he is kind to the unthankful and to the evil. Be ye therefore merciful as your Father is also merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful.</hi> 2. By most endearing <hi>Promises, Ver.</hi> 38. <hi>Give, and it shall be given unto you;</hi> especially of Life Eternal. <hi>Mat.</hi> 25.34, 35, 36. <hi>Come ye blessed of my Father,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>I was hungry, and ye gave me Food.
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:208153:127"/>Naked, and ye cloathed me. Sick, and in Prison, and ye visited me.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>On the contrary, covetous persons commit a <hi>double Theft:</hi> 1. Against their Neighbours, seeing God hath not made them absolute Owners of their Riches, but <hi>Stewards,</hi> who must dispose of them also for the good of others; which if they do not, they rob them of their right, <hi>James</hi> 5.1, 2, 3. 2. Against themselves, in defrauding their own Souls of those Blessings which God hath allowed them, <hi>Eccles.</hi> 4.8</p>
                     <p>As for such Misers: 1. None are more <hi>wicked,</hi> seeing they are neither good for themselves nor others, <hi>Eccles.</hi> 14.5. 2. None <hi>poorer,</hi> since thÃ´ they possess much, yet they enjoy nothing, and want as well what they have, as what they have not. 3. None more <hi>foolish,</hi> seeing they want for fear of wanting, and live poor that they may die Rich, not knowing who shall enjoy it. And 'tis generally observable, that what is scrap'd toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by sordid Covetousness, is lavisht out by vain Prodigality; or (if I may be allowed to speak it in the language of one <hi>[Cartwright]</hi> of the best Poets of the last Age)</p>
                     <p>
                        <q>
                           <hi>This Curse, Fate justly makes the Miser's Lot, The</hi> young Fool <hi>spends, what e're the</hi> old Knave <hi>got.</hi>
                        </q> 4. None are <hi>more wretched,</hi> seeing they deprive themselves both of the comforts of this life, and of the joys of the life to come.</p>
                     <p>I have the more insisted on this filthy Vice of Covetousness, of which our Saviour <hi>bids us be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware,</hi> Luke 12.15. and which is by the Scripture
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:208153:127"/>pronounced to be <hi>Idolatry,</hi> Mat. 6.24. Coloss. 3.5. Ephes. 5.5. and the <hi>Root of all Evil,</hi> 1 Tim. 6.10. Because there are none more upbraided with it as this day, (how justly, let them examin their own hearts) than the generality of those that pretend highest to the profession of true Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity, unto whom I would seriously recommend the perusal of <hi>James</hi> 5.1. <hi>Go too now you rich men, weep and howl for the miseries that shall come upon you. Your Riches are corrupted, and your Garments are moth-eaten. Your Gold and Silver is cankred, and the Rust of them shall be a witness against you, and shall eat your flesh as it were fire,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>The other Extreme, is <hi>Profusion</hi> and <hi>Wasteful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness;</hi> whereby People by spending above their means in unnecessary, dishonest, and riotous cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses expose themselves to the Devil's Temptations, in using unlawful means either to recover what they have mispent, or to supply their Extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gance: And so Luxury becometh the Mother of Covetousness, and Covetousness the Nurse of Lux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uriousness, one Sin being naturally apt to beget another, tho' seeming of a quite contrary nature.</p>

                     <pb n="244" facs="tcp:208153:128"/>
                     <p>For such is our Natural Corruption, that it maketh us prone to Lie; As soon as they are Born they speak Lies, <hi>Psal.</hi> 58.3. <hi>Every Man is a Liar,</hi> Rom. 3.4. Nay, we are apt to Lie not only for Advantage, but without any Cause, out of meer Vanity; and no less ready are we to Trespass against the Fame and good Name of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, which ariseth out of Envy and Pride, dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing us to Abase others to Advance our selves.</p>
                     <p>These Evils are restrain'd and condemn'd by this Command which generally forbiddeth all Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truth, and False, Vain, Offensive Speeches, comprehended under the term of Bearing False Witness, as being the chief, and of all others the most pernicious to our Neighbour's fame and estate.</p>
                     <p>'Tis an ill, tho' common, Proverb, and of bad Tendency, That <hi>Words are but Wind;</hi> for great Care is to be had of our Speech, seeing it is an excellent Faculty peculiar to Man, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a special Gift of God, it must not be Abused to his Dishonour, our Neighbours hurt, and our own Destruction; neither are Words slightly to be regarded, seeing we must for every Idle Word give an Account, <hi>And by our Words we shall be Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stified, or Condemned,</hi> Matth. 12.37. And the Wise Man assures us, <hi>That Life and Death are in the power of the Tongue,</hi> Prov. 18.21. And that a wholesome Tongue is a Tree of Life, whereas a Bad Tongue <hi>is an unruly Evil, and full of dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Poison,</hi> James 3.8. Which if we do not subdue and Rule, whatsoever profession we make of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, it is all in Vain, <hi>James</hi> 1.29.</p>
                     <pb n="245" facs="tcp:208153:128"/>
                     <p>Our Speeches therefore must be both <hi>true</hi> and <hi>charitable;</hi> For these must always go inseparably together, since Charity rejoiceth in Truth, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.6. and the Truth must be spoken in Love, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 4.15.</p>
                     <p>There are divers great and weighty Reasons which should dissuade and terrifie all persons from this odious Sin of Lying. As, 1. Because God is true, and the Author of Truth, and the Devil a Lyar, and the Father of Lyes: And as Truth ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth us like unto God, so Lyes render us like the Devil. 2. Because it is strictly forbidden in the Scriptures, <hi>Lev.</hi> 9.11. <hi>Exod.</hi> 23.7. <hi>Col.</hi> 3.9. <hi>Ephes.</hi> 4.25. and condemned as the Spawn of the old Serpent, <hi>John</hi> 8.44. and a thing abominable and odious unto God, <hi>Prov.</hi> 12.22. whence the Lyar is said to sin grievously, not only against his Neighbour, but also against God himself, as in effect thereby denying his Omniscience, <hi>Lev.</hi> 6.2.3. Because it perverteth the use of Speech, taketh away all Credit and Faith between Man and Man, and tends to overthrow all Human Society, which cannot stand without Contracts, Commerce, and Testimonies; nor they without Truth. 4 Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause God severely punished Lyars, <hi>Prov.</hi> 19.5. <hi>Psal.</hi> 5.6. <hi>Acts</hi> 5.3. And that both in this life with Infamy and Disgrace, (for it maketh a man base, infamous, and of no credit, so that usual Lyars are not believed even when they speak truth) and in the Life to come; For it excludeth out of Heaven, <hi>Rev.</hi> 22.15. and casteth Men in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to that Lake which burneth with Fire and Brim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stone, <hi>Rev.</hi> 21.8.</p>
                     <pb n="246" facs="tcp:208153:129"/>
                     <p>That we may not be guilty of violating our Neighbour's Good Name, (which to a good Man is no less dear than his Life, <hi>Eccles.</hi> 7.2. <hi>Prov.</hi> 15.30.) we must observe these Duties,</p>
                     <p n="1">1. To maintain an inward disposition, care and study, to preserve it; sincerely to be glad of, and rejoice in, his fair Reputation, and to be grieved when it is Sullied and Blemished; as also willingly and chearfully to hear his Praises, which is a sign of an honest Heart untainted with Envy and Self Love.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. To shut our Ears against, and discounte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, <hi>Tale-bearers, Whisperers,</hi> and <hi>Slanderers,</hi> for their detractions cannot hurt our Neighbour's Good Name if we will not hear and believe them. <hi>The North Wind driveth away Rain: so doth an Angry Countenance a Back biting Tongue,</hi> Prov. 25.23. And 'tis one of the Characters of him that shall be admitted a Citizen of Heaven, that he must be one, <hi>That Backbiteth not with his Tongue, nor doth Evil to his Neighbour, nor taketh up a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach against his Neighbour,</hi> Psal. 15.3.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Not to Nourish hard <hi>Suspicious Conceits</hi> of our Neighbour, but when they arise to suppress them, if the grounds of them be not evident, or very probable; we are not rashly to believe Evil of him, not sinisterly to construe all things well done and spoken by him, and to Interpret and take things doubtful in the most favourable sense, and better part.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. <hi>Silence</hi> and <hi>Secresie,</hi> for it is a Christian Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to keep secret our Neighbour's faults which
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:208153:129"/>proceed from Infirmity and Humane Frailty: we are not to publish them to his Reproach, much less to divert our selves, or others, with making sport at them, for therein we Contract on our selves his Guilt, and offend worse than he, such things being matter of Sorrow, not Merriment. In fine, we are never to divulge, or speak of them, unless it be either, First, To amend him by Admonition, and grave, modest, seasonable, Reproof, <hi>Lev.</hi> 19.17. <hi>Matth.</hi> 18.15. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.11. Or Secondly, To give necessary warning to the Hearer, that he may prevent some Evil that is intended against him, or danger which he may incur, <hi>Jer.</hi> 40.14. <hi>Acts</hi> 23.16. Or Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, To preserve him, that he be not infected with the Contagion of his sin, with whom he Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verseth. Or Lastly, When a Man is necessitated for the Publick Weal to discover anothers Faults and Crimes for the sake of Justice, and lest by si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence he himself become Accessary unto them, as in Cases of Treason, Murther, Felony, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="5">5. To consider the Odious Nature of this sin of Detraction, or the blacking and branding of our Neighbour's Good Name by secret and mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Words, or, (as the manner of too many is,) by giving <hi>suspitious Hints,</hi> and <hi>dark Innuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do</hi>'s, which is <hi>as certain</hi> a way of Murthering any Man's Reputation, and <hi>more likely</hi> than the <hi>broad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est Calamities,</hi> for it affords him not the opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of <hi>clearing his Innocence;</hi> and therefore this Vile Practice in the Holy Scriptures is compared to <hi>Bows and Arrows that Shoot in secret,</hi> Jer. 9.3,
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:208153:130"/>and 8. Psal. 64.3. <hi>To Coals of Juniper,</hi> Psal. 120.4. <hi>To a Sword,</hi> Prov. 12.18. <hi>To a Razor,</hi> Psal. 52.2. <hi>To the Tongue of a Serpent,</hi> Psal. 104.3. Eccles. 10.11. Moreover it is generally the sign of <hi>an Hypocrite,</hi> for such will declaim against the sins of others, that themselves may be thought very Good and Religious; and above other sins it maketh Men like unto the Devil, who hath his Name from Slandering, as having made it his bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness from the beginning, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.3. And as there are few of these Whisperers that speak <hi>truly</hi> of other Men's Faults, but either devise Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumnies of things that are not at all, or add at least something that is untrue of their own; so, tho' a Man should in such Case speak <hi>nothing but the Truth,</hi> yet if it be Maliciously to do Hurt, or out of a vain Custom to keep his Tongue in Ure, he is a <hi>Slaunderer;</hi> and offendeth if not against Truth, yet against <hi>Charity.</hi> So much of this too prevalent Vice of <hi>Back biting,</hi> and Wounding our Neighbours Good Name in private, or or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Discourses.</p>
                     <p>That which this Precept more expressly for bids is, <hi>Falshood</hi> and <hi>Corruption</hi> in <hi>Publick Testimonies,</hi> and <hi>Legal Proceedings,</hi> which are to be regarded above others, because it is the Judgment which <hi>God</hi> maketh, rather than Man, <hi>Deut.</hi> 1.17. 2 <hi>Chron</hi> 19.6. And therefore he that perverteth this Judgment, maketh <hi>God himself,</hi> as much as in him lies, guilty of his sin of <hi>Injustice.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Perjury</hi> is a sin most Odious and Abominable to God and Man, <hi>Prov.</hi> 6.18. and therefore God
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:208153:130"/>made Choice thereof as most Hainous, to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend under it all sins of the like kind; as in the other Commandments, Murther, Adultery, Theft. For he that giveth a false Testimony in a Court of Justice, Sins first, Against the <hi>Judg</hi> whom he la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boureth to pervert; Secondly, Against <hi>the Party</hi> concern'd; and Thirdly, Most of all against his <hi>own Soul;</hi> for a False Witness shall not be <hi>unpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisht,</hi> Prov. 19.5.</p>
                     <p>Under this Head also all perversion of Justice and Right, either by Judges, Jurors, Advocates, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> is included.</p>
                     <p>As we are not by any means to Violate our Neighbour's Good Name, so we are bound to preserve our own.</p>
                     <p>Now the means of getting and preserving a Good Name, are</p>
                     <p n="1">1st, Above all things to seek <hi>God's Glory,</hi> in a serious study to walk before him in Holiness of Life, and the Exercise of all Good Works. 2dly, To <hi>avoid Vain Glory,</hi> whereby Men seek more the praise of Men than of God. 3dly, To prefer the Testimony of <hi>a good Conscience</hi> before the Applause of Men, and therefore to take more care to <hi>be really good,</hi> than to <hi>seem so;</hi> and ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to approve our Hearts unto God, than our outward Actions unto Men. 4thly, To <hi>avoid Hypocrisie</hi> and Dissimulation, which tho' for a time it may gain a Reputation amongst Men, yet at length God will pull off this false Vizard, and expose the Hypocrite to Shame and Contempt. 5thly, To avoid that Glory which some Men seek

                     <head>The Tenth Commandment. <hi>Thou shalt not Covet thy Neighbour's House, thou shalt not Covet thy Neighbour's Wife, nor his Man-Servant, nor his Maid Servant, nor his Oxe, nor his Ass, nor any thing that is His.</hi>
                     </head>
                     <p>Some there are that <hi>divide</hi> this Tenth Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment into Two, making one to concern our Neighbour's House, the other his Wife, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But that such their distinction is frivolous and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful, as well as their Confounding of the two first Commandments into one; appears 1st, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the general Closure, <hi>Nor any thing that is his,</hi> shews it to be but one Command. 2dly, The substance of the Precept is in these words, <hi>Thou
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:208153:131"/>shalt not Covet,</hi> as St. <hi>Paul</hi> Cites them, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.7. 3dly, They are contain'd in one Verse and Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, whereas the rest, tho' short, are set down in distinct Verses. 4thly, In <hi>Deuteron.</hi> 5. the Coveting our Neighbour's Wife is first hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led; so that if these were Two Precepts, <hi>Moses</hi> of the Tenth should there have made the Ninth.</p>
                     <p>The proper <hi>Objects</hi> of this Precept are Men's Appetites, Thoughts and Affections, towards themselves and Neighbours; and the <hi>End</hi> of it is to shew that God's mediate Worship is to be performed not in outward Actions only, but in in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Affections also. And as the first Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment is the Rule of the first Table; so is this of the second Table; for as the first Precept directs the Heart, so the rest the Actions also: So the 5th, 6th, 7th, 8th, and 9th, Precepts Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der our Actions, but the 10th our very Heart. Whence 'tis evident, that this Precept is not su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluous.</p>
                     <p>For hereby God shews the perfection of that Charity which in his Law he requireth of us, and the Excellency of it above all Humane Laws; for as God is a Spirit, who is Omniscient and searcheth the Heart, so he requires Spiritual Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.14. And bindeth by his Law, (which is spiritual like himself,) not only the Hand, Tongue, and outward Man, as Men do by Humane Laws, but even the most inward hidden, and secret Thoughts and Desires of the Mind and Heart; so that as we must not Imagin, or desire any thing tending to our Neighbour's Hurt, but
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:208153:132"/>with all the powers of our Souls, exercise Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in doing them good, not seeking our own good only, but theirs also, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.5. Teaching us chiefly to observe our Hearts, and suppress the first and inward Motions of sin. <hi>Keep thy Heart with all diligence, for out of it are the Issues of Life,</hi> Prov. 4.23.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>His Wife.</hi>] The Wife of another must not be coveted; for such is the Union in Marriage between Man and Wife, that it is unlawful to covet an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other Man's Wife, not only to commit Adultery, but to enjoy for his own, tho' by lawful means, and after the other's death; For he cannot so covet her, but he must withal wish the Husband's death.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>His Man servant, nor his Maid servant.</hi>] These we are forbidden to covet, much more to use any means to intice them from their Masters to come to us; For tho' this were a greater Sin amongst the <hi>Jews,</hi> because they had a propriety in them, their Servants being part of their Goods: yet it is a Sin also amongst us, as being against Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and the common Rule of Justice, which en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joineth us to let every one have his own, and to do unto another as we would have him do unto us.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>His Ox nor his Ass.</hi>] These are named, to comprehend all other Goods moveable or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moveable, because they are of most necessary use.

                     <p>In the affirmative part this Precept requires at all times a pure, just, and charitable heart towards our Neighbours, and continually to make War against the Flesh, and the Lusts thereof.</p>
                     <p>Some Helps towards the fulfilling of this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, are,</p>
                     <p n="1">1. To mortifie Self-Love, and not to <hi>seek our own, but every man anothers wealth,</hi> 1 Cor. 10.24.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. To banish Envy from our Breasts.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. To labour to be content, to which end consider First, How many want those good things which thou enjoyest, who are far more worthy of them. Secondly, Thine own unworthiness of the least of God's Benefits. Thirdly, Meditate and relie upon God's Providence and Fatherly Care, who provideth all things necessary for thy Good and Salvation.</p>
                     <p>Lastly, Tho' we cannot in our present state of Corruption entirely and exactly keep this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand; <hi>For who can say his heart is clean? Prov.</hi> 20.9. which should humble us in the sight and sense of our sins, which have made us subject to the wrath of God, and the curse of the Law; that so despairing in our own Merits, we may with the more ardent desires flie unto the mercies of God in the satisfaction and obedience of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ; so being by Christ freed from the curse of the Law, we are to study, and with the highest diligence endeavor to conform our selves, our Souls and Lives to the prescript Rule of this holy and most perfect Law; and that mortifying the Flesh, with all the Carnal Concupiscences and
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:208153:133"/>Lusts thereof, we be daily more and more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed unto the Image of God in all Holiness and Righteousness, and walk worthy of our high Calling, and that profession we make of being the Followers of the Holy Jesus. In order to which <hi>PRAYER</hi> for the assistance of the Holy Spirit, being absolutely necessary, I shall in the next place treat thereof.</p>

               <head>CHAP. IX. <hi>Of</hi> Prayer, <hi>it ought not to be in an</hi> Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known Tongue; <hi>To</hi> Angels, <hi>or</hi> Saints <hi>departed unlawful; nor warrantable for the Dead.</hi> A <hi>short</hi> Exposition <hi>on tho</hi> Lord's Prayer.</head>
               <p n="1">I. <hi>PRayer</hi> is a Religious fiducial calling upon God, in the Name of Christ, with the heart, and sometimes with the voice, according to his Will for our selves and others, consisting generally of <hi>Confession of Sin, Petition for Grace,</hi> and <hi>giving of Thanks.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is both a <hi>Duty,</hi> and at the same time the highest <hi>Priviledge;</hi> whereby the poorest Soul can at any time approach the Throne of Grace, and pour out the desires of his Heart in all <hi>Straits,</hi> and for supply of all <hi>Wants,</hi> to the great and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Monarch of the Universe, as to a Father and a Friend, with assurance of being heard. It is the Hand of Faith, the Key of God's Treasury,
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:208153:133"/>the Soul's Solicitor. It procureth all Blessings, preventeth Judgments, <hi>sanctifieth</hi> all Creatures that they may do <hi>us good,</hi> seasoneth all <hi>Crosses</hi> that they can do <hi>us no hurt.</hi> It keeps the Heart in hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility, the Life in sobriety, strengthneth all Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, overcomes all Temptations, subdueth our Corruptions, purgeth our Affections, makes our Duties acceptable to God, our Lives profitable unto Men, and both Life and Death comfortable to our selves; the end of it being God's <hi>Glory,</hi> and our <hi>Salvation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">II. From this Definition or Description of Prayer, as we are taught the excellency and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity thereof, so likewise, that for persons to use Prayers in a <hi>Language</hi> that they do not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand; or to prescribe that the publick Prayers and Service of God in the Church, be performed in a <hi>Tongue Æ²nknown,</hi> or not understood by the generality of the People, is a great abuse and prophanation of this holy Duty, and, indeed, no better than <hi>vain Babling,</hi> or a <hi>mocking of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Because, 1. The very essence of Prayer con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisteth in the hearty concurrence of the Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing and Will, for want of which the Lord complains, <hi>This people draweth nigh to me with their lips, but their hearts are far from me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Nor is a general devout Intention suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient, because God requires, <hi>That we pray with the Spirit, and with the Æ²nderstanding also,</hi> 1 Cor. 14.15. Throughout which whole <hi>Chapter,</hi> St. <hi>Paul</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessedly argues against praying and speaking in an <hi>Æ²nknown Language</hi> in the Church, even in those
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:208153:134"/>on whom the Gift of Tongues was miraculously conferr'd.</p>
               <p n="3">III. We ought to pray to God alone, and to address our selves in and through the Mediation of Christ only. <hi>Mat.</hi> 4.10. <hi>Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God, and him only.</hi> Psal. 50.15. <hi>Call upon me in the day of trouble.</hi> Isa. 42.8. <hi>My glory I will not give to another.</hi> Luke 11.2. <hi>When ye pray, say, Our Father which art in heaven.</hi> Col. 2.18. <hi>Let no man beguile you in a voluntary humility, and worshiping of Angels.</hi> 1 Tim. 2.5. <hi>There is one Mediator between God and men, the Man Christ Jesus.</hi> John 14.3. <hi>No man comes to the Father but by me,</hi> with many other the like express Texts.</p>
               <p n="4">IV. Hence it follows, that praying to <hi>Angels,</hi> or <hi>Saints departed,</hi> is unlawful; which further ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears, by the following Considerations.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Because <hi>praying to Saints departed</hi> is not only <hi>vain</hi> and <hi>impertinent,</hi> since those that use it cannot shew how 'tis possible, or so much as probable, that the Saints should <hi>know their Prayers;</hi> and the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture seems to teach the contraryâ(<hi>The dead know nothing more,</hi> Eccles. 9 5. that is, none of the Transactions of this lower World. And <hi>Job</hi> 14.21. speaking of the dead, saith, <hi>Whether his Children shall be noble or ignoble, he shall not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand.</hi>) But the same is also very dangerous, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause <hi>Omniscience</hi> and <hi>Omnipresence,</hi> which be God's peculiar Attributes, are, by this practice, ascribed to those Creatures, at least by the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral tendency of the Action, tho' perhaps the Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shiper does not apprehend it so: For how else,
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:208153:134"/>for Example, shall the Blessed Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> hear a thousand Suppliants in a thousand different pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces calling upon her for several things at one and the same instant?</p>
               <p n="2">2. Because we must pray to none, but to whom we may do it in Faith without doubting, and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on good grounds, believing that <hi>we shall obtain, Mat.</hi> 21.22. <hi>James</hi> 1.5. But what Faith can we have in a practice uncommanded, nay, prohibited by God? What Faith when we are not, nay can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be sure that the Saints we address to, do hear our Prayers, much less that they will or can grant them? We do not believe in Angels or Saints, therefore <hi>how shall we call on them on whom we have not believed?</hi> Rom. 10.14.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Because the same is injurious to the Honour of Christ, who is our sole Mediator, not only of Redemption, but of Intercession too, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.24. <hi>Hebr.</hi> 7.25. Our great and onely Master of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quests in the Court of Heaven, hath not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly both invited and commanded us to apply our selves to none but him, but graciously promised to answer us. <hi>John</hi> 14.6. <hi>No man comes to the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther but by me.</hi> And <hi>ver.</hi> 3. <hi>Whatsoever ye shall ask in my Name, I will do it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1 Object. <hi>To evade the Force of these Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, the</hi> Romanists <hi>wonderfully puzzle themselves. Sometimes they alledge, That they give not the Honour due to God to these glorious Creatures, and to that purpose they invent Distinctions where there is no dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, as between</hi> Latria <hi>and</hi> Dulia, <hi>and tell us of Religious Worship,</hi> Supreme <hi>and</hi> Subordinate, Abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:208153:135"/>
                  <hi>and</hi> Relative, Terminate <hi>and</hi> Transient, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> But we have proved before, That there is but <hi>one only Object</hi> of Religious Worship, and so the same can be but of <hi>one kind,</hi> (tho' Civil Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours may be various, because the Objects are so, as one sort of Respect is paid to a Father, another to our Prince, another to a subordinate Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) and so all this Smoke vanishes; For Prayer being an Act of Religion, of Worship, and of Faith, ought not to be offered to any Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
               <p n="2">2 Object. <hi>Sometimes they pretend, They only ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour the Saints in Heaven, as they do good Men on Earth, and do but pray to them for the assistance of their Prayers; and that God, by some means, makes known such their Prayers to the Saints.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> To this I answer, 1. That this Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence is contrary to their Practice; for in their ordinary Prayers, Praises and Thanksgivings, they most commonly join the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> with God, <hi>Jesu Maria!</hi> coming in one word out of their mouths; and, <hi>Glory be to God and the blessed Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin,</hi> makes but one complete <hi>Doxology</hi> at the end of most of their Books. 2. Besides the vast dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference between desiring the Prayers of a good Man present here on Earth, and praying to Saints in Heaven; for the former of which we have Precept, and various Examples, but none of the latter. I say, this Suggestion is contrary to their Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> which <hi>Sess.</hi> 25. delares, <hi>That 'tis good and profitable,</hi> [it seems themselves thought
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:208153:135"/>it not necessary] supplicitÃ¨r Invocare, <hi>as humble Suppliants to invoke or call upon the Saints, who reign together with Christ, and to flie not only to their Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, but help and assistance too, for obtaining benefits from God, through his Son Jesus Christ our Lord, who is our only</hi> [they would not say Intercessor, but] <hi>Redeemer and Saviour.</hi> 3. If the Saints cannot know our Prayers till God acquaints them there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with; as for Example, when a <hi>Roman</hi> Catholick Seaman prays to St. <hi>Nicholas</hi> (the reputed tute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Saint of that profession) to preserve him from Shipwrack, God must signifie to that St. <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholas</hi> who it is calls upon him, and for what, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Saint can use any Intercession in the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fair; why then should not the poor Creature much rather go immediately to God, whom he is surc <hi>the Winds and the Seas obey?</hi> Is God less kind and merciful than the Saints?</p>
               <p n="3">3 Object. <hi>To help themselves out here, they say, 'Tis more humble to go to God by the good Offices of the Saints, than rudely to press in upon the Divine Majesty, as when we have to do with a Prince, we get some Favourite to facilitate our admission, and countenance our Petition.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> This Comparison is dishonourable to the Almighty, his ways are not as the ways of men, nor his thoughts as their thoughts. The best and greatest of Princes, tho' analogically cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Gods,</hi> are yet really but men, to whom we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not speak <hi>when</hi> and <hi>where</hi> we would, but to God
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:208153:136"/>who is everywhere, and always present, we may. Man, perhaps, sometimes, thrÃ´ <hi>Pride</hi> will not, or, thrÃ´ <hi>Carelesness,</hi> regards not; thrÃ´ <hi>Ignorance</hi> knows not, or, thrÃ´ <hi>Business,</hi> cannot hear and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dress the Grievances of such as sue unto him: Or his Attendants may keep off Petitioners, and not allow them Access. But there are no such Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diments in God, therefore no such need of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king an Interest in the Saints to address our Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications to him, <hi>who is a God hearing Prayers,</hi> and to whom therefore alone the <hi>desires of all flesh</hi> should come.</p>
               <p>Lastly, <hi>They alledge, That their praying to Saints is not injurious to God or Christ, because they pray not to them</hi> as to God, <hi>but address their Prayers only as to his</hi> Mother, <hi>his</hi> Friends <hi>and Favourites, whom they suppose to intercede only in his Name and Mediation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> If Prayer be an Act of Religious Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, and so due only to God, you ought not to offer it to any Creature, tho' never so much a Friend; <hi>For the Lord is a jealous God.</hi> Now sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose a married Woman accused of lying every Night with her Neighbour, not able to deny the Fact, should go about to justifie it, by maintaining the Act is not Adultery, because she never lies with him as her Husband, but as her Husband's special Friend and near Relation, Would such a Plea be allow'd in any Judicatory? 'Tis the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Office of the Lord Jesus, to offer up the Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of his People to be our Advocate with the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, 1 <hi>John</hi> 2.1. And to appear in the presence of God for us, <hi>Hebr.</hi> 9.24. Therefore to apply our
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:208153:136"/>selves to any other Mediators in Heaven, to repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent our Prayers to God, in what manner, or up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on what pretence soever it be, is highly deroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory to the Honour and Office of the Blessed Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus â This much was thought fit to be said touching the Object of our Prayers, or who we are to direct them to.</p>
               <p n="5">V. The Subjects of Prayer or Persons for whom we are to pray, are our selves, and others; in general, <hi>all Men living,</hi> even our <hi>Enemies,</hi> Mat. 5 44. but principally for those that are of the <hi>Houshold of Faith.</hi> For all <hi>sorts</hi> and <hi>degrees</hi> of Men, especially publick persons, as <hi>Rulers,</hi> and such as are in Authority; or <hi>Ministers,</hi> who watch over our Souls: As also for our <hi>Relations, Friends, Benefactors,</hi> and such as <hi>desire,</hi> or for whom we have <hi>promised</hi> our Prayers. But it is not our Duty to pray for the <hi>Dead,</hi> because</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Whatsoever is done without Faith, is sin,</hi> Rom. 14.23. But for praying for the Dead we have no Command from God, nor Promise to be heard, nor Example in Holy Scripture, and consequently we cannot do it in Faith. 2. Such Prayers are vain and unprofitable; <hi>Now the Child is dead, why should I fast and pray,</hi> saith <hi>David?</hi> 2 Sam. 12.23. <hi>As the Tree falleth, so it lieth;</hi> And <hi>as Death leaveth a Man, so will Judgment find him. They that dye in the Lord are blessed,</hi> Rev. 14.13. and need not our Prayers; and those that dye in their Sins, can have no benefit by them: <hi>For out of Hell there is no Redemption.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="6">VI. We have a prescript Rule, and perfect
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:208153:137"/>pattern of Prayer of all kinds, left us in that Prayer which our Lord and Saviour Christ taught his Disciples, (and in them all succeeding Ages) thence call'd, <hi>The Lord's Prayer.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This is both a <hi>Prayer</hi> which we both may and ought to pray; and also a <hi>platform of Prayer,</hi> whereunto we are to conform, and by which we ought to regulate all ours; and therefore, as St. <hi>Matthew</hi> biddeth us, <hi>pray after this sort,</hi> Mat. 6.9. so St. <hi>Luke</hi> biddeth us, <hi>when we pray, say, Our Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Luke</hi> 11.2. The one propounding it as the most perfect Model to be imitated, the other as the most excellent Form to be used of all Christians.</p>
               <p>The Lord's Prayer consisteth of three parts 1. A Preface. 2 Petitions. 3. A Conclusion The Preface is contain'd in these words, <hi>Our Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther which art in Heaven.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Our Father.</hi>] These words contain 1. A Duty. 2. A Prerogative. The Duty is implied in the first word <hi>Our,</hi> whereby we are taught what Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and Affection should reign in the hearts of Christians, that they are bound to pray one for another, as well as each for himself. As the Eye seeth not for itself alone, but for the good of the whole Body; and the Hand laboureth not for it self alone, but for the whole Body: so should we be Suitors to <hi>Our</hi> God and Father for all Graces and good Things for our Brethren, all that are or may be Children of the same Father with us. The Prerogative is signified by the word <hi>Father,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:208153:137"/>we are taught, that God in Christ is become our Father, and giveth us both the priviledge, (<hi>John</hi> 1.12.) and Spirit of Sons (<hi>Gal.</hi> 4.6.) so to call him. By Father therefore here is not only understood the first person of the Trinity, but the whole Trinity; For as God is said to be our Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in respect of Creation, Redemption, and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation, so the whole Trinity have their parts in them all; And as the Name of <hi>Father,</hi> when it is put with any other person of the Trinity, is taken personally, that is, for the first person of the Trinity; so when it is put with his Creatures, it is taken essentially for the whole Trinity; so that in Christ our Mediator, we that were by nature the Children of wrath, are become the Sons of God, and Heirs of eternal life, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.3. Herein, 1. The wonderful Love of God is manifested, <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold what Love the Father hath shewed unto us, that we should be called the Sons of God,</hi> 1 Joh 31.2. That we have good warrant to call God <hi>Father,</hi> for we have God's promise, <hi>You shall be my people, and I will be your God,</hi> Ezek. 36.28. We have Christ's Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand here, <hi>When ye pray, say, Our Father;</hi> And we have the Holy Ghost's Instruction, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.15. <hi>Ye have received the Spirit of Adoption, whereby we cry, Abba, Father.</hi> 3. Hereby our Faith is much strength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in our prayers, since we pray not to an inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orable Judge, but to a merciful, tender, loving Fatherâ<hi>If ye then being evil, know how to give good gifts unto your children, how much more shall your Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther which is in Heaven give good things to them that ask him?</hi> Mat. 7.11.</p>

If God be our Father, there is to this Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge annext a necessary Duty on our parts, that we should both reverence and imitate him as our Fatherâ<hi>A Son honoureth his Father, and a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant his Master: If then I be a Father, where is mine Honour?

               <p>
                  <hi>Which art in Heaven</hi>] These words direct us to meditate on the Greatness, Glory, powerful Providence, Wisdom and Holiness of that infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite God, to whom in our Prayers we approach, in which respects he is said <hi>to dwell in the High and Holy Place,</hi> Psal. 11.4. Isa. 57.15. Not that he is excluded from Earth, or included in Heaven, or any place; For he filleth all places, and the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven of Heavens is not able to contain him, <hi>Jer.</hi> 23.24. 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 8.27. But he is especially said <hi>to be in Heaven,</hi> for these four Causes. 1. Because his Glory is most manifested there; even as the Head or the Heart may be said to be the Seat of the Soul, because its Operations are there most seen, tho' it be not in any one part of the Body included; so the Lord is said to be in Heaven, because his glorious Majesty doth there most ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear. 2. Because Heaven is the place where Christ's Body is, the Palace of Angels, and Court of Saints, where they behold the glorious Face of God, and where we all expect the Consumma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our Happiness. 3. Because God doth there Reign perfectly, that is, absolute Obedience is there paid unto him. 4. Because from thence he manifesteth himself unto us by Revelations,
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:208153:138"/>Visions, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and from thence governeth the World, sending Light, Heat, Rain, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> so that whereas God our Father is said to be in Heaven, his Majesty doth not only appear, but also his Dominion and Power, to which all things in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and Earth are subject; For as his Goodness in the word, <hi>Father;</hi> so his power in these words, <hi>Which art in Heaven,</hi> are manifested.</p>
               <p>This therefore teacheth us, 1. That we must humble our selves in our Prayers before the great God of Heaven and Earth, who is able to damn both Body and Soul in Hell-fire; and that we ought to come before him with all possible Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, because tho' he vouchsafes us the Honour to call him <hi>Father,</hi> yet he is not an ignoble or earthly, but an heavenly Father, and a most glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious and tremendous Majesty. 2. That we ought, when we pray, to elevate our hearts to Heaven, and there be as it were present with God. 3. That we ought especially to pray for heavenly things, look for all good things for Body and Soul from thence, and take care likewise that our Conversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions be holy and heavenly.âThus far of the Preface.</p>
               <p>The Petitions of the <hi>Lord's Prayer</hi> are in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber six; whereof the first three (like the first Table of the Law) especially concern God's Glory; the other three (as the second Table) our own good.</p>
               <p>This Order is observ'd, to put us in mind, that the Glory of God is to be prefer'd above all things; and yet so kind and merciful is our Lord,
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:208153:139"/>that both the Petitions in this Prayer, and the Precepts of the first Table of his Commandments (which both principally relate to his own Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship) are likewise as pertinent to that which tends to the preservation and happiness of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, as the other which more immediately refer to our Welfare and Necessities.</p>
               <div n="1" type="petition">
                  <head>The First Petition.</head>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Hallowed be thy Name.]</hi> That is, that in all things God may be glorified; that He, who in himself, his Word and Works is most holy and glorious, may be acknowledg'd and honour'd as such, by us and all Mankind, <hi>Psal.</hi> 96.8. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.9. For,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. By <hi>Hallowed</hi> or <hi>Sanctified,</hi> is not meant that we should or can add Holiness to God; but to acknowledg God's Majesty holy, and every way excellent as it is. The like phrase being used, <hi>Luke</hi> 7.35. <hi>Wisdom is justified of her Children;</hi> that is, acknowledged and declared to be just.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. By the <hi>Name</hi> of God, we are to understand God himself, (1 <hi>Kings</hi> 5.5. <hi>Isa.</hi> 26.8) as he maketh known to us the <hi>Fame</hi> and <hi>Glory</hi> of his Nature, otherwise <hi>unconceivable;</hi> the Nature of a thing being in Scripture call'd <hi>its Name,</hi> as <hi>Acts</hi> 1.15. So that in this Petition we desire these three things: 1. That we may be enlightned to know the Majesty of God aright as far as we are capable, and it is expedient for us. 2. That we may confess and acknowledg the Lord to be such an One as the Scriptures have Recorded of him
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:208153:139"/>concerning his Greatness, Worthiness, and Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes. 3. That we may give unto him due Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, and bear his Image of Holiness before the World; in our <hi>Hearts,</hi> by loving and believing in him; in our <hi>Tongues,</hi> by reverent speaking of Him, his Word, and Works; as also by praying unto, and praising of him. In the <hi>whole Man,</hi> by obeying him, and holy living to him.</p>
                  <p>These therefore fail in the performance of this first Petition: 1. All Atheists, that in their hearts acknowledg no God. 2. All Heathen and other Idolaters; as also wilfully or negligently igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant persons, that worship not God aright. 3. All proud persons that seek not God's Glory, but their own. 4. All Blasphemers, Swearers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that Ireverently take the Name of this Great JEHOVAH in their mouths. 5. All those ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>durate hearts that will neither be allured by God's Mercies, nor moved by his Judgments; or that are unthankful for the Benefits continually received from him. All that are negligent in of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering up the spiritual Sacrifice of Prayer, and call not upon his Name. And <hi>in fine,</hi> All ungod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Livers whatsoever, as Adulterers, Thieves, Drunkards, Lyars, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> For none of these can truly pray that God's Name may be glorified, whil'st they persist in Rebellion against his Laws, and by their practices bring the greatest dishonour upon God, as suggesting either that there is no such <hi>Being,</hi> or that <hi>He is such an one as themselves,</hi> not regarding or punishing evil Actions.</p>

                  <head>The Second Petition.</head>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thy Kingdom come.]</hi> This Word <hi>Thy,</hi> shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth that there is a double Kingdom, the Kingdom of God, and the Kingdom of Satan, called the <hi>Kingdom of darkness,</hi> Col. 1.13. We pray there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, that Sin may not reign in our Mortal Bodies, that we may not be Bondslaves to the Prince of the Air, but that the Lord would admit us into his Kingdom; that is, Rule and Reign over us by his holy Word and Spirit here; and receive us into Glory hereafter.</p>
                  <p>The Kingdom of God is taken in Scripture ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther 1 For the Government of the whole world, disposing all Creatures to their proper Ends, as Psal. 145.13. <hi>Thy Kingdom is an everlasting Kingdom, and thy Dominion endureth throughout all Ages.</hi> 2d. For that Government whereby the Lord Ruleth and reigneth in the hearts of his servants in this world, which is called <hi>the Kingdom of Grace;</hi> of which it is said, <hi>The Kingdom of God is within us,</hi> Luke 17.21. 3. For that Government whereby he Ruleth in Heaven most perfectly in the Saints and Angels, called <hi>the Kingdom of Glory,</hi> in which the Elect shall reign with Christ for ever, <hi>Psal.</hi> 94.14. Now in this <hi>Petition,</hi> we are not to take the word <hi>Kingdom</hi> so much in the first, as in the second and third Acceptations. So that in this Petition we desire these three things, 1. That the Lord would build in us the Kingdom of Grace, and Rule in our hearts by his Word and Spirit, sanctifying us to all Obedience and Godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:208153:140"/>2. That this Kingdom of Grace may be increased in us daily, that we may grow in Grace and Godliness from the measure of the gift of Christ, to the measure of the age of the fulness of Christ, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 4.3. That our hearts may be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamed to long for, and desire the Kingdom of Glory, that Sin and all Wickedness being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded, we may perfectly glorifie our heavenly Creator, as <hi>Paul</hi> prayed, <hi>Phil.</hi> 1.23. <hi>I desire to be dissolved, and be with Christ.</hi> And as the Saints of God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.23. <hi>We that have received the first fruits of the Spirit, even we do sigh and mourn, wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for the Adoption, even the Redemption of the Body.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>These therefore fail in the performance of this second Petition: 1. All they that suffer Sin to reign in their hearts, and yield obedience there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unro. 2. All they that quench the Spirit of God, and will not be ruled by the good motions and holy directions of the same. 3. They that make no Conscience of their ways, but contemn or ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glect the hearing of the Word of God, and pray not heartily for the continuance, free passage and flourishing estate of the same. 4. They that labour not for perfection in Grace, that are not prepared for the coming of Christ, or do not wish and long for his appearance in Glory.</p>

                  <head>The Third Petition.</head>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thy Will be done in Earth as it is in Heaven.]</hi> The Will of God is said to be twofold: 1. His hidden Will, which is the immutable purpose &amp; decree of future Events, which Will is always done, neither
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:208153:141"/>can it be changed or altered by any. <hi>My counsel shall stand, and I will do whatsoever I will,</hi> Isa. 46.10. None can resist it, for <hi>there is no wisdom, no under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing nor counsel against the Lord,</hi> Prov. 21.30. 2. The Will of God is taken for whatsoever doth declare his Will, and proceed from the same, as his Precepts, Counsels and Laws, which the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle calleth <hi>the good Will of God,</hi> Rom. 12.2. and is commonly called his <hi>Revealed Will,</hi> because it is revealed unto us by his Word. Of this Will we read, <hi>Ps.</hi> 103.21. <hi>Praise ye the Lord all ye his servants which do his Will;</hi> that is, his Commandments. And this is the Will which here we pray may be done. So that in this Petition we desire, 1. To know God's Will, without which we cannot do it. 2. To deny our selves, and our own Wills, and to do the Will of God, submitting our Wills to his, as well in Adversity, as Prosperity 3. To perform the Will of God without delay, <hi>in earth;</hi> that is, whilst we are upon the face of the earth breathing. 4. To do it as the Angels do it <hi>in Heaven,</hi> that is, zealously, readily, carefully, sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely, and wholly, (not doing one of his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, and leaving another undone.)</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Even as]</hi> These words do not signifie Equali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, but Similitude; we are to imitate them in the <hi>manner,</hi> tho' we know we cannot equal them in <hi>measure</hi> and <hi>degree</hi> of obedience. In which sense also God himself faith, <hi>Be ye holy as I am holy, Lev.</hi> 11.44. that is, Imitate me in Holiness: For tho' we cannot do God's Will on Earth so per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly as the blessed Angels perform it in Heaven,
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:208153:141"/>yet we ought to strive for perfection, and resolve on perfect obedience to his Will.</p>
                  <p>These therefore fail in the performance of this third petition. 1. They that follow their own Wills either in Life or Judgment, and will not inquire after and obey the Will of God. 2. They that will not with patience submit their Wills to Gods Will in Adversity. 3. They that post off their Obedience till their Death-Bed, and refuse to give their whole Life to the doing of God's Will on earth. 4. They that are lukewarm, and not zealous in the Service of God, contented with imperfect Obedience, taking Men, and not Angels for their Example. Lastly, They that do God's Will in outward matters only to be seen of Men, that seem to do it, but not sincerely, as all Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Give us]</hi> to put us in mind, that we hold all that we enjoy, of God's Bounty: For tho' in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of our Labour, or buying any thing, it may be called <hi>Ours,</hi> yet we must still own it as the Gift of God, both because we are unable by any service or labour to deserve the least crum of
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:208153:142"/>Bread, or drop of Water at his hands; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause our labour and diligence cannot prevail without his blessing, nor the Creatures be profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to us when we have them; so that the Rich are to use this Petition as well as the poorest, pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing therein not so much for the outward things, as for God's blessing upon them.</p>

                     <hi>Our]</hi> It should be our own Bread that we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire to eat, that is, such as cometh to us by the blessing of God on our lawful Labours in an honest Vocation; not the <hi>Bread of Iniquity,</hi> got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten by dishonest means; nor the <hi>Bread of Idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness: For he that will not labour, should not eat,</hi> 2 <hi>Thess.</hi> 3.8.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Bread.]</hi> Hereby is meant all things necessary to this temporary Life, as Meat, Drink, Cloath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Habitation, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But we must desire Bread, not Delicacies; such a portion of worldly Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodations as (in God's sight, not our own vain imaginations and desires) are convenient for us; not vast Riches and Superfluities to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume on our Vanities and Lusts.</p>
                  <p>So that in this Petition we desire, 1. That God would in Christ vouchsafe us all things necessary
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:208153:142"/>for the maintenance of this mortal Life. 2. That he would bless our pains and labours in our Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations to this end and purpose. 3. That he would give them unto us at such times and so often as Nature's necessity requireth, which is daily and hourly. These therefore fail in the performance of this Petition, 1. Who attribute to the Creature vertue of refreshing, which cometh meerly from the blessing of the Creator. 2. Who distrustfully hoard up for time to come, as the Fool, <hi>Luke</hi> 12.19. <hi>Soul take thy rest, for thou hast Goods laid up for many years.</hi> 3. They eat not their own Bread, as Thieves, Cheaters, Oppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors, idle common Beggars, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and all such as spend their days idly without pains and labour in some lawful Vocation. 4. That pray for super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluous things, and depend not upon God's Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence for the least things, as a Morsel of Bread; or are covetous, and not contented with that which they have more or less; seeing 'tis more than we deserve, and is distributed by a most wise and loving Father, who knows what is fit for us, infinitely better than we our selves.</p>

                  <head>The Fifth Petition. <hi>And forgive us our Trespasses, as we forgive them that trespass against us.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>Our Sins are called <hi>Debts</hi> in the Gospel of St. <hi>Luke, Chap.</hi> 11.4. and the word here translated <hi>Trespasses</hi> signifies the same, which term is used in regard of the resemblance between them; For as
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:208153:143"/>a Debt doth bind a Man either to make satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, or else go to Prison; so our Sins bind us, either to satisfie God's Justice, or else to suffer Eternal Damnation. And because we cannot of our selves satisfie the one, nor willingly would in our selves suffer the other, therefore we sue to the Lord in Christ to forgive them. Under which words Forgiveness of Sins are understood, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the guilt, but also the punishment due to the same; as likewise the benefits of Justification, Sanctification, Redemption, and Glorification.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>As we forgive,</hi> &amp;c.] These words serve, 1. For our <hi>Instruction</hi> to teach us, that God requireth this at our hands, that we should Forgive as we would be Forgiven; that we should be merciful, as he is merciful; which is notably exprest by the parable of the Servant, that having his Debt remitted, would not Forgive his Brother, <hi>Matth.</hi> 18.34. 2. For our <hi>Comfort,</hi> to give us to understand, that if we which are sinful Men can remit Wrongs and Injuries done against us, much more will our hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Father <hi>(whose mercy is above all his works)</hi> Forgive his Children, when, by true Repentance, they shall turn unto him.</p>
                  <p>Here we are to Note, That tho' we may and ought to Forgive the Injury done against us, yet we cannot the Sin therein done against God, for God alone forgiveth Sins: He that stealeth of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendeth the Law, the Injury is done against him from whom he steals; but the Sin against God's Law, <hi>Thou shalt not steal,</hi> the party may Forgive the Injury, but God only must the Sin.</p>
                  <pb n="275" facs="tcp:208153:143"/>
                  <p>So that in this Petition we request of God, 1. Grace feelingly to know, and frankly and tremblingly to confess, without excuse or exte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuation, the great Debt of our Sins, and our ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Inability to satisfie for the same, or the least part thereof. 2. That upon our confession and true humiliation for Sin, it would please the Lord not to lay to our charge either the guilt or pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment of our Sins, but that for the Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and unutterable passion of Jesus Christ, he would raze them out of his Book. 3. That by the infallible testimony of his good Spirit, he would assure our Consciences of the free remis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of them, and <hi>seal us unto the day of redem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption,</hi> Ephes. 4.30. 4. Seeing God requireth the like Forgiveness at our hands towards our Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, we further entreat his grace, that we may as heartily Forgive Injuries done against us, as we desire Forgiveness of our own Sins at the hands of God.</p>
                  <p>These therefore fail in the performance of this Fifth Petition: 1. The <hi>Hereticks,</hi> call'd <hi>Nova<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians,</hi> are here condemn'd, who denied Forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of Sins committed after Baptism. 2. The Church of <hi>Rome</hi> maintaining that God doth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit the Fault, but not the punishment. 3. The <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aharists,</hi> who think they can be without Sin in this life. 4. All those that confess not their Sins to God, and grieve not for Corruptions, with an hearty Resolution to forsake and watch against them for the Future. 5. All that do not endeavor to keep
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:208153:144"/>a clear Conscience towards God and Man, and to be posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed of that peace within, which the world can neither give, nor take away. Lastly, those that are so maliciously bent against their Brethren, that by no means they can be brought to forgive them; which persons are so far from Forgiveness at the hands of God, as, in effect, they pray that he would never forgive them. A matter of dreadful consideration, and much to be lamented.</p>

Now God is said to lead into Temptation in these two Respects: 1. Because he <hi>permitteth</hi> Satan to tempt us. 2. Because in his <hi>Justice</hi> he useth him as an Instrument of his wrath.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Into Temptation.]</hi> Temptation in Scripture is taken two ways: 1. For that Temptation wherewith the Lord doth prove and try those that are his, of which <hi>Moses</hi> speaks, Exod. 20.20. <hi>Fear not, for the Lord is come to prove you.</hi> That is, whether you will obey his Precepts as you promised, <hi>Chap.</hi> 19.8. And so, <hi>Psal.</hi> 66.10. <hi>Thou, O God, hast proved, thou hast tryed us, even as silver is tryed:</hi> For God's Tryals always tend to his own Glory, and the good of his Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren. 2. It is taken (and that more generally) for that Temptation wherewith the Devil doth assault us, and this is any enticement of the soul or heart (either by the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of Man's Nature, the allurements of the World, or the more immediate suggestions of Satan) to any sin: And in this sense God is said, <hi>Not to tempt any man,</hi> James 1.13. Hence some of the Ancients define <hi>Temptation</hi> to be a corrupt affection, tending or enticing to Evil, and to imagin this to come from God, is horrible Blasphemy:
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:208153:144"/>For the matter of Temptation is in us, even our own Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupiscence, the Devil needeth but to bring his Bellows to this Fire, and it is forthwith kindled.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>But deliver us from Evil.]</hi> This expoundeth the former by a flat Contrary, as thusâ<hi>Lead us not into Temptation,</hi> but <hi>pull us out of it,</hi> (even when we fall into it by our own Infirmity) and that with <hi>Force.</hi> For by <hi>delivering,</hi> here is meant a <hi>forcible rescuing</hi> of our Nature, neither able nor willing to help it self out of these dangers, therefore the Church saith, <hi>Cant.</hi> 1.4. <hi>Draw me, we will run.</hi> And Christ, <hi>John</hi> 6.44. <hi>No man can come to me except the Father draw him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>By <hi>Evil</hi> is not here meant <hi>Temptation,</hi> for Temptations are many times profitable, whence we are bid count it <hi>all Joy, when we fall into divers Temptations,</hi> (that is, of <hi>probation,</hi> for so it appears by the words following) <hi>knowing that the tryal of your Faith worketh patience,</hi> Jam. 1.2, 3. But by <hi>Evil</hi> is here understood the <hi>sin</hi> to which we shall be tempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, either by the Devil, the World, or our own Corruption, which is of itself simply evil: As much as to sayâIf it be thy good pleasure suffer us not to be tempted, left we miscarry; or at least if we be tempted, suffer us not to be overcome, and led away captive thereby.</p>
                  <p>So that in this last Petition we desire 1. That since we cannot be tempted without the Will of God, <hi>John</hi> 1.10. nor resist Temptation without his power, he would gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciously be pleased to remove those things that expose us to it, tye up Satan, and restrain his malice, or else make us wise and able to know and avoid the Charms of all our spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Enemies. 2. That in our Tryals (if he see good to prove us) he would keep us from all murmuring and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pining, as charging him with Injustice, or hard measure; and give us grace to behold his holy hand therein, and make that good use of them for which he sent them. 3. That therefore he would not take his holy Spirit from us in our Tryals, but support us in and against our Temptations; or if he leave us at any time for our humiliation to our own weakness, he would yet graciously raise us again with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease of spiritual strength and courage. 4. That he would preserve us from all carnal Security, and both from despair
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:208153:145"/>and presumption of his mercies, finally putting an end to all Tryals, and in his own good time treading Satan, with all his Forces, under our Feet.</p>
                  <p>These therefore fail in the performance of this Petition, 1. All that imagin God to be the Author of Sin. 2. These that presumptuously think that, <hi>of themselves,</hi> they are able to withstand Temptations. 3. Those that are careless, and regard not whether they overcome, or be overcome of Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptations, as ready to yield to evil motions, as the World, the Flesh, and the Devil are to suggest them, and seek not to be delivered from this damnable Estate. 4. All those who do not with diligence flie from and avoid the appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of Evil, that prevent not the occasions and beginnings of Sin, as, <hi>Ill Company, Idleness, Intemperance,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>We come now to the Conclusion of this Prayer expressed in these words:
<q>
                        <hi>For thine is the Kingdom, the Power, and the Glory, for ever ever, Amen.</hi>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>This Conclusion is a Doxology, implying, that <hi>Praise</hi> or <hi>Thanksgiving</hi> ought to be inseparably joyned with <hi>Prayer,</hi> the acknowledging of one mercy, being the readiest way to obtain another.</p>
                  <p>And tho' these words be not repeated by St. <hi>Luke,</hi> yet they are expresly mentioned by St. <hi>Matthew chap.</hi> 6.13. and therefore ought not to be omitted, because we are to ground our assurance of obtaining what we pray for on God, from whom all things we ask do flow, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently to him all Glory must return.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>For thine is the Kingdom]</hi> The Kingdom is said to be the Lords (according to the general stream of Interpreters) for these two Causes. 1. Because he is Owner of all things that are. 2. Because he hath sovereign Rule over all things at his will, therefore we ought to pray unto him, and to none else.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The Power]</hi> Hereby is meant the Omnipotency of God, whereby he is able to do all things, which is an encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to pray to him, who is able to effect any thing we
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:208153:145"/>desire according to his Will, and to strengthen us to any thing which in Duty we ought to do, altho' there be no strength in us.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And the Glory.]</hi> We are in our Prayers to ascribe all Glory to the Lord our God: 1. Because the Reason <hi>why we pray to God,</hi> is, for that whatever we have, we have it from him, for he is King &amp; Lord over all; And whatsoever strength of Grace we have, 'tis deriv'd from him the Fountain and Giver of all Grace. 2. The Reason why we would have our Prayers granted, is, That God's Kingdom, Power and Glory may be advanced; because the Kingdom and Power is the Lords, to him we pray; and because all Glory ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertaineth to him, we return to him Thanksgiving, and the Glory of all, saying with the <hi>Psalmist, Not to us, O Lord, not unto us, but unto thy Name give the Glory,</hi> Psal. 115.2.</p>
                  <p>These therefore fail in the right knowledge of this Conclusion: 1. Who deny the general Providence and Government of God, thinking that all things come by Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, Fortune, or Chance. 2 Such as deny his Omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency, or rest upon their own Abilities. 3. All those that either take to themselves, or give to any other the Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, Glory and Honour which are due only unto the Lord.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Amen.]</hi> This last word is taken two ways, 1. For a Testimony of our Faith, and so it signifies as much asâ <hi>It shall be so:</hi> That is, that we firmly believe that the Lord, in his good time, will grant our Requests. 2. For a Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of our fervent desires, and then the acceptance of this word is, <hi>So be it;</hi> denoting our earnest desires, that the Lord would grant our Petitions. By the first, we are ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monished to pray <hi>Faithfully.</hi> By the second, <hi>Fervently.</hi> And therefore in <hi>Publick Prayers,</hi> this word is to be said as well by the Minister as the People.</p>
                  <p>As <hi>this</hi> is a most absolute Form of Prayer, which being prescribed by our Lord, to refuse the use of it, savours of a proud Contempt of Christ's Ordinance, so we are not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined always to the same words, for that would argue Neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence in this Duty; wherein oftentimes variety of expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions, according to our present Wants and Circumstances are necessary, for the pouring out our Souls before the Lord,
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:208153:146"/>
                     <hi>Hos.</hi> 14.3. So as sometimes one Petition is more than the rest to be importuned and insisted upon; for both Christ himself (<hi>John</hi> 17.1.) and his Apostles (<hi>Acts</hi> 4.24.) are Recorded to have prayed in other words, which yet are referrable to these; So that we may be allowed to pray in other Expressions, provided they are agreeable to this Pattern, and that we pray with Spirit and Affection and with Understanding also, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.15.</p>
                  <p>In fine, whenever we pray, which ought to be continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, that is, at all times, when we have occasion, which being every moment, though we cannot so frequently have opportunities of solemn prayer, yet we ought at all times to be in a devout frame of Spirit for that Duty, and set apart some times every day, (as the morning, going to meals, and after them, and when we go to rest, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) for this Duty to be solemnly performed.</p>
                  <p>Which must always be done, 1. with Reverence and due Apprehension of the glorious Majesty, Persons, and Attributes of the Godhead. 2ly, With Faith and Holy Confidence in Christ thy Mediator, and in the Promises of Gods Word general and particular. 3ly, With ferven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, from a deep sense of wants, weaknesses, and impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of our suits. 4ly, With Humility, by reason of Sin, Corruption, and Impotency. 5ly, Thankfulness for Mercies and Promises abundant, all sufficient. 6ly, Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, for others Welfare, the Church, the Magistrate, the Minister, thy Friends, those that have begged thy Prayers, or have thy promise to pray for them, and for all that are afflicted. 7ly, With care and watchfulness to put away the throng of worldly thoughts, before thou be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginnest, lest they distract thy mind; and in the Action it self, how thou prayest or hast prayed, never resting in the outward work done, unless thou feel some in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Affection and Fruit of thy prayers.</p>
                  <p>As to our outward Behaviour in prayer, we are to use such comely Reverent Gestures of Body, as may express us sensible both of our own vileness, and the Majesty of that God with whom we have to deal. As the bowing of our Knees, <hi>Eph.</hi> 3.14. The lifting up of our hands and
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:208153:146"/>eyes to Heaven, <hi>Lam.</hi> 3.41. <hi>John</hi> 17.1. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Which yet are not always or absolutely necessary, <hi>Luke</hi> 18.13. pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided our hearts be lifted up, <hi>Psal.</hi> 25.1. and our stub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born Souls bowed down, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.10. And nothing done unbeseeming the Company with whom we pray and the kind of prayer we are engaged in, which if <hi>publick</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires such behaviour as may witness our Communion one with another, and desire of mutual Edification.</p>

               <head>CHAP. X. <hi>Of Death, Remedies against its Terror; Of Purgatory. The Resurrection, last Judgment, Heaven and Hell.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>WE now proceed to the <hi>four last things,</hi> which every Man ought in the <hi>first</hi> place to mind, <hi>viz. Death, Judgment, Heaven</hi> and <hi>Hell.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That it is appointed for all Men <hi>to dye,</hi> is not only de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared by God's Word, but manifest to all Persons Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, who cannot but <hi>see</hi> that their Ancestors are gone, and behold every day one or other carried to the Grave; Yet most Men Cark and Care, Plot and Contrive, as if they were to live here for ever; some are so slavishly afraid of Death, that it renders their whole Life un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comfortable, others scarce ever think of it, till they are surprized by it, and then are swallowed up with hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror and astonishment. All these Errors are to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voided, we are to keep our Souls throughly sensible of our Mortal Condition, and that every day, every mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment may be our last; Death is to be expected and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided for, not frightfully feared.</p>
               <div type="remedies">
                  <pb n="282" facs="tcp:208153:147"/>
                  <head>Certain Remedies against the fear of Death.</head>
                  <p n="1">1. To consider, that 'tis as Natural to Dye as to be Born; a Necessity from which none are exempt, and why shouldst thou complain or be afraid of <hi>that,</hi> which all Men, even the greatest Princes are subject unto?</p>
                  <p n="2">2. To number our days, and so apply our hearts unto wisdom, <hi>Ps.</hi> 9.12.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. To acquaint our selves with <hi>Death</hi> before we come to Dye; To contemplate oft thereon, and consider that we have every night an Emblem or <hi>Memento</hi> to it, when, we put off our Cloaths and go to sleep.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. The Sting of Death is <hi>Sin;</hi> 'tis this Arms it with terrors; let us therefore keep our Hearts in a constent fear of <hi>Sin,</hi> more than of <hi>Death,</hi> and then Death will be nothing frightful.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. To disintangle and take off our Affections from the things of this Life, remembring that they are not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained but with Toil, nor kept but with Solicitude. As they encrease, they procure envy; and in their quitting us, are apt to afflict us with sorrow and heaviness.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. As we must expect once to dye, so we must not think to dye well and all at once; we must with the Apostle learn <hi>to dye daily,</hi> and with <hi>Solomon, to prepare our work without, and make it ready in the field.</hi> If we would not <hi>dye in Sin,</hi> we must practise a <hi>dying to it.</hi> We must not leave any thing to do at Death, but to dye.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. We must look <hi>beyond Death,</hi> as well as on it; that the thoughts of the Fire of Hell may drive out the Fire of Lust; and the Contemplation of the Joys of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, make us be weary of this vale of Sin and Misery,
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:208153:147"/>and desire with St. <hi>Paul to be dissolved and be with Christ.</hi> For,</p>
                  <p>Lastly, The only certain Cordial and Preservative that can keep us undismayed on a Death-Bead is <hi>Faith</hi> in our Blessed Lord and Redeemer, who by his Passion and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection hath <hi>swallowed up death it self in victory,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. and enabled us Triumphantly to say, <hi>O death where is thy sting?</hi> So that Death which was, and is still to the wicked the <hi>King of Terrors,</hi> becomes to all true Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians, their <hi>Rest,</hi> their <hi>Harvest,</hi> their <hi>Conquest</hi> and their <hi>Crown.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>After Death follows JUDGMENT, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.27. that is, the pronouncing and executing of the irrevoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Sentence of Absolution or Condemnation; which is done, <hi>partly</hi> on every Man in particular at the hour of Death, his Soul being received into Bliss, or doomed to endless Torments. But <hi>fully</hi> and generally upon all Men both Soul and Body, at the second coming of Christ, <hi>Acts</hi> 17.31. The death of every one severally going im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately before the particular Judgment; The general Resurrection of all preceding the final Judgment which shall be at the last day.</p>
                  <p>The Church of <hi>Rome</hi> maintains, That besides Heaven and Hell, there is a Third place, where Souls depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out of this World in the Grace of God, must make Satisfaction for the Temporal Sins for which they have not here fully satisfied, which place they call <hi>Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For they teach, That although God freely gives to all, that are in a state of Grace, (that is, Confessed unto and Absolved by a Priest) forgiveness of the guilt of all their Mortal Sins, and freedom from Eternal Death, yet satisfaction must notwithstanding be made for the Temporal Punishments due to those Sins; Wherefore, and for as much also, as Persons have much Venial Sin and Corruption in them, in which they oftentimes dye; therefore it is necessary, that they should for the Expi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:208153:148"/>of these Sins, and for the Satisfaction of God's Justice, as to the Temporal Punishments, either do or suffer such Penances, Fastings, Prayers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as may effect the same here, or (where those are not suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently performed) suffer the pains of Purgatory, where (as in a Prison) they must remain in grievous Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, till they have made full Satisfaction, and are compleatly Purged; and then they are admitted into Heaven; which Release may be hasten'd, or their pains mitigated, either by the good Works of their survi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Friends, as by their Prayers and procuring of Masses to be said, or by Indulgences obtained from the Pope.</p>
                  <p>But this whole Notion is altogether built upon the Sand borrowed from the Fables of the <hi>Heathen Poets,</hi> and promoted for secular ends,</p>
                  <p>For, 1. 'Tis grounded on several salse Doctrins, as that some Sins are <hi>Venial;</hi> That good works <hi>merit</hi> of God, and those of the Living avail for the Dead, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> all which are refuted before.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. It is highly derogatory to the Honour of Christ to say that Men are purged by suffering pains in Purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory, where they satisfie for lesser Sins, and for the Temporal Punishment of their greater Sins; for the Blood of Christ is the only Purgatory of all our Sins, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.3. Who, <hi>when he had by himself purged our sins, sat down at the right hand of the Majesty on high.</hi> And Chap. 9.14. <hi>How much more shall the Blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit offered himself without spot to God, purge your consciences from dead works, to serve the living God?</hi> Whence he is called a <hi>Ransome for all,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.6. Christ is a compleat Saviour; his Blood cleanseth us from all sin, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.7. He is able (and sure he is no less willing) to save to the utmost those that come to him, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.25.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The Scripture teaches us no such <hi>Middle place</hi> of Souls after Death, as Purgatory; But the quite contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.18. <hi>The things which are seen are temporal, but the things which are not seen are eternal.</hi> Whence it
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:208153:148"/>follows, That there is no place invisible after this place, which is not everlasting, therefore no Purgatory. Again, the Apostle saith, That the whole Church, all the Family whereof Christ is Head, is either in Heaven or upon the Earth, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.10. <hi>That in the fulness of time, he might gather together in one, all things in Christ, both which are in Heaven, and which are on Earth.</hi> And, Chap. 3.15. speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Christ, he saith, <hi>In whom the whole family in heaven and earth is named. John</hi> 5.24. <hi>Verily, verily. I say unto you, He that heareth my word, and believeth on him that sent me, hath everlasting life, and shall not come into condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation: but is passed from death to life:</hi> If he come not into Condemnation, he cannot be cast into a place of punishment.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. 'Tis said, <hi>Rev.</hi> 14.13. <hi>Blessed are the dead that dye in the Lord, for they rest from their labour:</hi> Where Rest is, there is no Torment; <hi>Ergo,</hi> no Purgatory. If any did ever need satisfactory Purgation after Death, sure that <hi>Thief</hi> who was Converted upon the Cross, ought to have suffered the pains of Purgatory many years; yet our Lord saith to him. <hi>This day shalt thou be with me in paradice,</hi> Luke 23.43.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Were it necessary, that Believers must satisfie God for Temporal punishments arrear, and for lesser sins, then such of them as shall be alive upon Earth, at Christs second coming, must first go into Purgatory, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they can meet the Lord in the Air, 1 <hi>Thess.</hi> 4.17.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. Since they own the Apocryphal Books for Canoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal, what will they say to that of <hi>Wisdom</hi> 3.1. The Souls of the Righteous are in the hand of God, and <hi>there shall no Torments touch them?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Object. <hi>Whosoever shall speak</hi> against the Holy Ghost, it shall not be forgiven him, neither in this world, nor that which is to come, <hi>Matth.</hi> 12.31. <hi>Wherefore it seems there is some Remission of sins in the World to come, which cannot be either in Heaven or Hell, therefore must be in</hi> Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory.</p>

                     <hi>Answ.</hi> 'Tis plain this is the same fire intended, <hi>ver.</hi> 13. which cannot be that of Purgatory. 1st, Because 'tis the fire of the Day of Judgment, when Purgatory is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed by them that maintain it, (or rather are maintained by it) to end. 2dly, This fire burns the works of Men, only their Hay and Stubble, not their Persons as Purgatory is supposed to do. 3dly, This fire tries both Good and Bad, all pass through it, the Gold no less than the Stubble. The Text is only a figurative way of speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing frequent in Scripture and common Discourse, as the delivered Jews are said to be as <hi>Firebrands pluckt out of the burning,</hi> Amos 4.11. So here, <hi>He shall be saved so as by fire,</hi> that is, <hi>not without difficulty,</hi> and the fire shall consume so much of his works as were Hay and Stubble, so that he shall lose that part of his Reward.</p>
                  <p>The immediate Antecedents of the general Judgment are, 1. The <hi>coming of Christ,</hi> that is, his return from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, to which he is ascended, in his humane visible Body (but with unspeakable Glory) environ'd with a flame of fire, attended with all the Host of Elect Angels, to Judge all the Inhabitants of the Earth. 2dly, The Resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of the Dead, whereby at the Voice of Christ and the sound of the Trumpet attending him, both the Dead shall be raised with their own Bodies, and every part there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, though never so dispersed, and change the living, so that it shall be with them as if they had been long dead.</p>

                  <p>This return of Christ to Judgment was revealed even in the Patriarchs times, <hi>Jude</hi> 14. <hi>Enoch also, the seventh from Adam, prophesied of these, saying, Behold the Lord cometh with ten thousand of his saints, to execute judgment upon all, and to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince all that are ungodly among them, of all their ungodly deeds,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>David</hi> also foretels it, <hi>Ps.</hi> 50.3.4.5, &amp; 6. It is testified by Angels, <hi>Acts</hi> 1.11. <hi>This same Jesus which is taken up from you into heaven, shall so come, in like manner as ye have seen him go into heaven.</hi> And St. <hi>Peter</hi> not only assures us of the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty, but acquaints us with something of the manner of it, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. where, <hi>ver.</hi> 10. he saith, <hi>The day of the Lord shall come as a thief in the night,</hi> (surprizing and unexpected) <hi>in the which the heavens shall pass away with a great noise, and the elements shall melt with fervent heat, the earth also and the works that are therein shall be burnt up.</hi> From which destructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of this visible World the Apostle raises a most powerful Argument to press us to holiness of life, <hi>ver.</hi> 11. <hi>Seeing then that all these things shall be dissolved, what manner of persons ought ye to be in all holy conversation and godliness!</hi>

                     <hi>The Resurrection of the Dead,</hi> the Scripture proves, 1. By many express Testimonies, as <hi>Job</hi> 19.25. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the whole Chapter, and many other the like Texts. 2dly, By Examples of diverse that were raised from the Dead. 3dly, By Types, as <hi>Aaron</hi>'s Rod budding, the Jews returning from <hi>Babylon, Ezech.</hi> 37. and the Assumption of <hi>Enoch</hi> and <hi>Eliah.</hi> 4thly, By reasons drawn, from the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of God which is not broken by Death <hi>Matth.</hi> 22.30. From the promises of Life Eternal, and especially from our Lord Christ, who is not only the Type and Example of our Resurrection, but the beginning also thereof for from the Life of the Head, we irrefragably conclude the Life of the Mystical Body.</p>

                  <p>The form of the great and tremendous Judgment is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed by the manner of the proceedings in Courts of Justice, to which belong, 1. <hi>The Cognizance of the Cause;</hi> And so it is said, <hi>The Books were opened,</hi> Rev. 20.12. 2dly, <hi>The Act of Judgment,</hi> in pronouncing sentence, which to the wicked shall be full of horrour, <hi>Go ye cursed into everlasting fire prepared for the Devil and his Angels.</hi> But to the godly unspeakably comfortable, <hi>Come ye blessed of my Father, possess the Kingdom prepared for you from the beginning of the World,</hi> Matth. 25. 3dly, <hi>The Execution of Judgment</hi> which shall imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately follow the pronouncing of the Sentence, so that the wicked in the presence of the godly shall be carryed away to <hi>Hell,</hi> but the godly being caught up to meet Christ shall with him enter into <hi>Life Eternal,</hi> Matth. 25. ver. the last, and 1 <hi>Thes.</hi> 4.17.</p>
